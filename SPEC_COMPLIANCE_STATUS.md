# Zen Language Spec Compliance Status

## Summary
This document summarizes the current alignment status between the Rust implementation (lexer, parser, compiler) and the LANGUAGE_SPEC.zen source of truth.

## ‚úÖ Working Features

### Core Language Features
- **No Keywords**: The language correctly implements no reserved keywords
- **@ Symbols**: Both `@std` and `@this` are properly tokenized and functional
  - `@std` imports work correctly
  - `@this.defer()` works as expected
- **Pattern Matching**: The `?` operator for pattern matching works correctly
  - Simple conditionals: `condition ? { block }`
  - Boolean pattern matching: `value ? | true { } | false { }`
- **Variable Declarations**: All forms work correctly
  - Forward declarations: `x: i32` followed by `x = 10`
  - Immutable assignments: `y = 10`, `z: i32 = 20`
  - Mutable declarations: `w:: i32`, `v ::= 30`, `u:: i32 = 40`
- **Assignment Operators**: All three operators work as specified
  - `=` for immutable assignment
  - `::=` for mutable assignment with type inference
  - `:` for type declarations
- **Loops**: Direct loop constructs work properly
  - Infinite loops: `loop(() { ... })`
  - Conditional loops with break

### Partial Implementations
- **@meta Token**: Token is recognized in lexer but compile-time metaprogramming not fully implemented
- **UFC (Uniform Function Call)**: Basic structure present but not all cases handled
- **Pointer Types**: `Ptr<>`, `MutPtr<>`, `RawPtr<>` partially implemented

## ‚ùå Issues Found

### Critical Issues
1. **Range Loops Not Working**: `(0..10).loop((i) { ... })` only executes once
   - The range.loop() method call is not being properly parsed as a MethodCall on a Range expression
   - The loop body compiles but doesn't iterate properly
   - Root cause: Parser issue where `(range).loop()` is not generating the correct AST

2. **Option Type Issues**: `Option<T>` with `Some(T)` and `None` not working correctly
   - Pattern matching on Option types doesn't work as expected
   - Values are incorrectly handled

### Missing Features
- **Error Propagation**: `.raise()` method for error propagation not implemented
- **Traits System**: `.implements()` and `.requires()` from `@std.meta` not implemented
- **Compile-time Metaprogramming**: Full AST manipulation at compile time not available
- **SIMD Operations**: `simd.add()` and similar operations not implemented
- **Inline C/LLVM**: `inline.c()` for low-level control not implemented

## üîß Fixes Applied During Review

1. **Forward Declaration Fix**: Fixed typechecker to properly handle forward declarations
   - Variables can now be declared with type first: `x: i32`
   - Then initialized later: `x = 10`

2. **Mutable Assignment Operators**: Ensured `::=` and `::` work correctly
   - `v ::= 30` for mutable with inferred type
   - `w:: i32` for mutable forward declaration
   - `u:: i32 = 40` for mutable with explicit type

3. **Pattern Matching**: Verified `?` operator works for conditionals

## üìã Recommendations

### High Priority
1. Fix range loop iteration issue - requires parser changes to generate correct MethodCall AST
2. Implement Option<T> type properly with Some/None variants
3. Add .raise() for error propagation

### Medium Priority
1. Complete @meta support for compile-time metaprogramming
2. Implement trait system with .implements() and .requires()
3. Add full UFC support for all function types

### Low Priority
1. Add SIMD operations support
2. Implement inline C/LLVM for low-level control
3. Add advanced generic constraints

## Test Coverage
- Basic variable declarations: ‚úÖ
- Pattern matching: ‚úÖ
- Direct loops: ‚úÖ
- Range loops: ‚ùå (only executes once, 0..4 should itterate 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 )
- Option types: ‚ùå
- @std imports: ‚úÖ
- @this.defer: ‚úÖ
- Error handling: ‚ùå
- Traits: ‚ùå

## Conclusion
The Rust implementation has good coverage of core language features but needs work on:
1. Fixing the range loop parser issue
2. Implementing Option types correctly
3. Adding error propagation with .raise()
4. Completing the metaprogramming features

The lexer is mostly complete, the parser needs fixes for range.loop() method calls, and the typechecker/codegen need extensions for the missing features.
