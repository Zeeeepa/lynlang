# TODO: Remove if/else, enforce only '?' conditional

- [ ] Add a parser error for any use of 'if' or 'else' keywords: "Zen does not support 'if' or 'else'. Use the '?' conditional operator instead."
- [ ] Ensure the lexer does not treat 'if' or 'else' as valid keywords.
- [ ] Remove or update any test or code that references 'if' or 'else'.
- [ ] Re-run all tests to confirm only '?' is supported for conditionals.
