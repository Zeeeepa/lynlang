# âœ… COMPLETED: Conditional Feature Implementation

**The conditional feature has been successfully implemented!** âœ…

## âœ… **COMPLETED TASKS:**

- [x] Add a parser error for any use of 'if' or 'else' keywords: "Zen does not support 'if' or 'else'. Use the '?' conditional operator instead."
- [x] Ensure the lexer does not treat 'if' or 'else' as valid keywords.
- [x] Remove or update any test or code that references 'if' or 'else'.
- [x] Re-run all tests to confirm only '?' is supported for conditionals.

## ðŸŽ‰ **STATUS: COMPLETE**

The conditional feature is fully implemented and working. All tests pass and the language now uses only the `?` conditional operator as designed.

**Conditional expressions are working correctly with the ternary syntax: `x ? y : z`**
