# Zen Language Implementation Progress Report

## ✅ Successfully Implemented from LANGUAGE_SPEC.zen

### Core Syntax
- ✅ Immutable assignment: `x = 42`
- ✅ Mutable assignment: `counter ::= 0`
- ✅ Import syntax: `{ io } = @std`
- ✅ Function definitions: `main = () void { ... }`

### Enum Types
- ✅ Basic enum definitions: `Shape: .Circle | .Rectangle`
- ✅ Generic enum definitions: `Option<T>: .Some(T) | .None`
- ✅ Enum variant creation: `.Some(42)`
- ✅ Enum registration in symbol table
- ✅ Proper parsing of enum syntax with `:` operator

### Basic I/O
- ✅ `io.print()` function works correctly

## 🔧 Issues to Fix

### Pattern Matching
- ❌ Pattern match blocks don't output/execute properly
- ❌ Boolean short form `flag ? { ... }` doesn't work
- ❌ Full pattern matching `value ? | pattern { ... }` doesn't work
- ❌ Enum variant pattern matching not yet working

### String Features  
- ❌ `io.println()` not available (only `io.print()`)
- ❌ String interpolation `${variable}` not working

### Collections & Iteration
- ❌ Range syntax `(0..10)` not implemented
- ❌ `.loop()` method not implemented
- ❌ UFC (Uniform Function Call) not working

### Memory & Concurrency
- ❌ Allocators not implemented
- ❌ `@this.defer()` not implemented
- ❌ Actor, Channel, Mutex not implemented

## Current State

The core language structure is in place:
1. Lexer and parser work correctly for most syntax
2. Enum type system is functional
3. LLVM code generation works for basic cases
4. Module system and imports work

The main gaps are:
1. Pattern matching execution/output
2. Advanced string features
3. Collection iteration
4. Memory management features

## Next Priority Tasks

Based on LANGUAGE_SPEC.zen, the highest priority items are:

1. **Fix pattern matching output** - Critical for language usability
2. **Implement io.println()** - Basic requirement from spec
3. **Add string interpolation** - Core feature in spec examples
4. **Implement range and .loop()** - Essential for iteration
5. **Add UFC support** - Key language feature

These would make the core examples from LANGUAGE_SPEC.zen work.
