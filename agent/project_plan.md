# Lynlang Project Plan

## Project Status
**Current Status**: All tests passing! Ready for new feature implementation  
**Date**: 2025-08-23  
**Test Status**: All tests passing (111 tests total)

## Completed Today
âœ… Fixed void pointer codegen support
  - Added support for void pointers (*void) in LLVM codegen
  - Map void pointers to i8* in LLVM IR (standard practice)
  - All void pointer tests now pass

âœ… Fixed lexer != operator tokenization
  - Added special handling for ! operator to check for != combination
  - != is now correctly tokenized as Operator('!=')
  - All lexer tests pass

## Current Work
âœ… Fixed parser struct with methods test failure
  - Fixed lookahead logic to correctly advance past '=' when detecting struct/enum/function
  - All parser tests now pass

## Next Tasks (Priority Order)
1. Implement pattern matching syntax (? operator) in parser
2. Add comptime block parsing support (partially done - top-level only)
3. Implement member access (dot operator) parsing
4. Implement loop range syntax (0..10)
5. Write comprehensive tests for new features

## Project Architecture Overview

### Core Components
- **Lexer** (src/lexer.rs) - Tokenization âœ… Working
- **Parser** (src/parser/) - Modular parsing system ðŸ”„ Needs improvements
- **AST** (src/ast.rs) - Complete type definitions âœ…
- **Codegen** (src/codegen/llvm/) - LLVM IR generation ðŸ”„ Mostly working
- **LSP** (src/lsp/) - Language server support ðŸ”„ Basic implementation

### Test Coverage
- Parser tests: 27/28 passing
- Codegen tests: All passing (31 tests)
- Lexer tests: All passing (15 tests)
- FFI tests: All passing (5 tests)

## Critical Features Needing Implementation

### Parser Gaps (High Priority)
- Pattern matching syntax (? operator)
- Comptime block parsing
- Member access parsing (dot operator)
- Method definitions in structs

### Codegen Features (Medium Priority)
- Pattern matching code generation
- Comptime evaluation
- Generic type instantiation
- Trait/behavior system

### Type System (Lower Priority)
- Dedicated type checker module
- Type inference engine
- Generic type support

## Testing Strategy
- 80% implementation time
- 20% testing time
- Focus on end-to-end tests
- Write unit tests for critical paths

## Communication
- Email updates to l.leong1618@gmail.com on major milestones
- Commit and push after every file edit
- Use .agent/ directory for planning and notes

## Build Commands
```bash

## Recent Commits
- f0cebb5: Fix lexer != operator tokenization
- cb5b668: Fix void pointer codegen support
- 24143e4: Fix struct parsing and update tests
- 5f44932: Fix lexer and parser for loop statements

## Notes
- Language is systems-focused with LLVM backend
- Emphasizes explicit syntax with minimal keywords
- Supports C FFI for library integration
- Compile-time metaprogramming via comptime blocks
