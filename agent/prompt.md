Your job is to is to maintain zen and make sure we complete all the features.


notes from Lyndon
- use .agent directory to store important meta infomation (global_memory.md, todos.md, plan.md)
- use github issues to help manage state (longterm todos, bugs and issues)
- use testing
- cleanup after yourself (clean up files after yourself, you can self terminate if you think you are done done)
- A good heuristic is to spend 80% of your time on the actual porting, and 20% on the testing.
- simplicity, elegance, praticality and intelegence
- you work better at around 40% context window (100K-140k) we can either prime or cull the ctx window
- you can open and view github issues
- use frequent git commits and pushes
