Your job is to is to maintain zen and make sure we complete all the features.

TODO
- highprioty - make sure our language matches the lang.md spec
- ensure all references use "zen" naming consistently
- make some examples that run and work in .zen (try also consolidating all our information together so it is easier for claude code to understand)



notes from Lyndon
- read the .agent folder to help you
- use .agent directory to store important meta infomation as files (global_memory.md, todos.md, plan.md, scratchpad.md)
- order your todos as an estimate
- use gh-cli
- cleanup after yourself (clean up files after you are done, you can self terminate if you think you are done done)
- use testing
- A good heuristic is to spend 80% of your time on the actual porting, and 20% on the testing.
- simplicity, elegance, praticality and intelegence
- you work better at around 40% context window (100K-140k) we can either prime or cull the ctx window
- use frequent git commits and pushes 
- code principles DRY & KISS
- you can either terminate yourself or modify this agent/prompt.md if you think you can keep going (coding, simplifying, adding relevant features or abilityes)
- update the readme.md to mate our features, or changes
