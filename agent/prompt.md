## 📁 Project Organization Guidelines

### CRITICAL: File Organization Rules
- **NEVER** place test files in the root directory
- **ALL** test files must go in the `/tests/` folder
- **ALWAYS** check existing tests in `/tests/` folder before creating new ones to avoid duplication
- Scripts belong in `/scripts/` folder, not root
- **ALL** analysis reports, progress documents, and thinking artifacts must go in `/.agent/` folder (NEVER in root)

### Pre-Development Checklist
Before making any changes, **ALWAYS**:
1. Check the entire project structure (except `/target/`, `/node_modules/`, `/.git/`)
2. Search for existing implementations in `/tests/` folder
3. Look for duplicate files across folders  
4. Review existing patterns in codebase before implementing new code

### Test File Naming
- Use descriptive names: `zen_test_[feature].zen`
- Group related tests in single files rather than creating many small test files
- Check for existing test coverage before adding new tests

### Analysis and Progress Artifacts
- **ALL** analysis reports (ARCHITECTURAL_CLEANUP_REPORT.md, RAISE_ISSUE_ANALYSIS.md, etc.) → `/.agent/` folder
- **ALL** progress tracking documents → `/.agent/` folder  
- **ALL** thinking and planning artifacts → `/.agent/` folder
- **NEVER** clutter the root directory with temporary analysis files

### Loop Syntax (CRITICAL)
Zen's loop construct manages **internal state** and can pass multiple parameters to closures:
- ✅ `loop() { ... }` - Infinite loop with `break` statement
- ✅ `loop(() { ... })` - Closure-based loop with internal state management
- ✅ `loop((handle) { ... })` - Loop provides control handle (`handle.break()`, `handle.continue()`)
- ✅ `(range).loop((i) { ... })` - Range provides index/value to closure
- ✅ `collection.loop((item) { ... })` - Collection provides each item to closure
- ✅ `collection.loop((item, index) { ... })` - Collection provides item and index
- ✅ `range.loop((value, handle) { ... })` - Multiple parameters: value and control handle
- ❌ `loop(condition) { ... }` - **INCORRECT**: external state condition not supported
- ❌ `loop(i < 3) { ... }` - **INCORRECT**: external variable condition not supported
- **Key principle**: Loop manages internal state and provides context via closure parameters
- **Patterns**: 
  - `loop(() { condition ? { break }; ... })`
  - `loop((handle) { condition ? { handle.break() }; ... })`
  - `(0..10).loop((i) { i == 5 ? { break }; ... })`
