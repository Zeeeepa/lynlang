# Lynlang Compiler Improvements

## Summary

Successfully improved the Lynlang compiler to pass all 14 tests with proper LLVM IR generation.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Type System Enhancements
- Added `Void` variant to the internal `Type` enum for proper void function handling
- Improved function type handling with better separation of concerns
- Added proper support for function pointer types in variable declarations

### 2. Fixed Conditional Expression Implementation
- Completely rewrote the conditional expression compilation to generate proper control flow
- Now generates correct comparison instructions (`icmp eq`) for pattern matching
- Properly handles branching between multiple patterns with test blocks
- Generates correct phi nodes for merging results from different branches

### 3. String Handling Improvements
- Fixed string constants to be marked as `constant` instead of just `global`
- Properly generates `constant [N x i8]` arrays for string literals

### 4. Error Handling & Robustness
- Better error messages for type mismatches
- Improved handling of function pointer types
- More robust variable loading with proper type tracking

### 5. Code Quality
- Removed all unused imports and warnings
- Added `#[allow(dead_code)]` annotations for methods that might be used in the future
- Cleaner organization of compiler passes

## Test Results

All 14 tests now pass:
- ✅ test_simple_return
- ✅ test_binary_operations
- ✅ test_conditional_expression
- ✅ test_variable_declaration
- ✅ test_function_call
- ✅ test_undefined_variable
- ✅ test_type_mismatch
- ✅ test_undefined_function
- ✅ test_invalid_function_type
- ✅ test_nested_conditionals
- ✅ test_while_loop
- ✅ test_function_pointers
- ✅ test_recursive_function
- ✅ test_string_operations

## Example IR Generation

### Conditional with Pattern Matching
```llvm
%cmp = icmp eq i64 %x1, 1
br i1 %cmp, label %then0, label %test1
```

### String Constants
```llvm
@string = constant [13 x i8] c"Hello, World!"
```

## Next Steps

The compiler is now in a solid state with proper LLVM IR generation. Potential future enhancements could include:

1. Add support for more complex pattern matching (structs, enums)
2. Implement proper function pointer calls (currently simplified)
3. Add support for more data types (arrays, structs)
4. Implement the Loop construct mentioned in the language design
5. Add optimization passes
6. Implement a proper parser to replace the manual AST construction
