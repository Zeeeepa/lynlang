# Zen LSP Improvements - 2025-09-30

## Summary
Enhanced the Zen Language Server Protocol implementation with improved UFC method resolution, better allocator warnings, and semantic token highlighting for special constructs.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced UFC Method Resolution
- Added `parse_generic_type()` helper to properly handle nested generics like `HashMap<K, Option<V>>`
- Improved type inference to extract base types from complex generic expressions
- Added support for methods on:
  - `Option` types with methods like `unwrap`, `is_some`, `map`, `and_then`
  - `Result` types with methods like `raise`, `is_ok`, `map_err`, `unwrap_err`
  - All collection types (`HashMap`, `DynVec`, `Vec`, `Array`)
- Better handling of chained UFC calls on nested generic types

### 2. Improved Allocator Warnings
- Enhanced detection of collections created without allocators
- Added support for more collection types: `HashSet`, `BTreeMap`, `LinkedList`
- Improved error messages with detailed quick-fix suggestions
- Changed severity levels:
  - Missing allocator: `ERROR` (compilation will fail)
  - Allocating methods: `INFORMATION` (helpful hint)
- Added related information in diagnostics with suggested fixes
- Better detection of allocator-related arguments in function calls

### 3. Semantic Token Highlighting
- Added special highlighting for:
  - UFC method calls (distinguished from regular function calls)
  - Allocator-related functions like `get_default_allocator()`
  - Error propagation with `.raise()` (highlighted with async modifier)
  - Collections that require allocators (highlighted specially)
- Improved dot operator handling to properly tokenize UFC chains
- Added context tracking for allocator-related code

### 4. Type System Improvements
- Better handling of nested generics in type inference
- Improved parsing of generic type parameters
- Support for deeply nested types like `Result<Option<HashMap<String, Vec<i32>>>>`
