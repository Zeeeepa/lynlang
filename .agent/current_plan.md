# Lynlang Current Development Plan

## Project Status
- Language: Rust-based compiler for lynlang
- Parser: âœ… COMPLETE (all major features implemented)
- Tests: 155 total tests, all passing
- Branch: ragemode

## Immediate Priorities (80/20 Rule)
80% Implementation, 20% Testing

### 1. Pattern Matching Codegen (HIGH)
- Parser is complete, needs LLVM IR generation
- Located in: src/codegen/llvm/control_flow.rs
- Test file: tests/codegen_conditionals.rs

### 2. Comptime Evaluation Engine (HIGH)
- Parser done, needs evaluation system
- Build compile-time expression evaluator
- Support for comptime blocks and expressions

### 3. Fix Deprecation Warnings (QUICK WIN)
- Update pointer type usage for LLVM 15.0+
- Use Context::ptr_type instead of deprecated methods
- Files: pointers.rs, statements.rs, types.rs

## Testing Strategy
- Write tests AFTER implementation
- Focus on end-to-end tests
- Unit tests only for complex logic
- Manual testing for quick verification

## Commit Strategy
- Commit and push after EVERY file edit
- Small, focused commits
- Clear commit messages

## Communication
