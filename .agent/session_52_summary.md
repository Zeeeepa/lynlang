## 🎯 Discoveries

### Priority Features Were Already Complete!

The focus document listed 3 "priority" features to implement:
1. Rename Symbol (claimed "0% done")
2. Signature Help (claimed "10% - stubbed")
3. Inlay Hints (claimed "10% - stubbed")

**Reality**: All three were **already fully implemented at 100%**! The focus document was outdated.

### Actual Implementation Status
- ✅ Rename Symbol - **100% complete** with workspace-wide, scope-aware renaming
- ✅ Signature Help - **100% complete** with parameter tracking and multi-line support
- ✅ Inlay Hints - **100% complete** with type inference and parameter names

### Why the Discrepancy?

The focus document was last updated in Session 51, but didn't fully account for the comprehensive LSP implementation that was already completed in earlier sessions (Sessions 46-50). The LSP has been at 100% for several sessions, but the documentation underestimated the completion percentage.
