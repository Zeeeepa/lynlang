# Zen Language Maintenance - Completion Summary

## Tasks Completed âœ…

### 1. Language Specification Alignment
- Reviewed `lang.md` specification thoroughly
- Identified key syntax elements:
  - NO if/else keywords - only `?` operator
  - Single `loop` construct for all iteration
  - Unified pattern matching with `?`, `|`, `->`, `=>`
  - Declaration system: `:=` immutable, `::=` mutable

### 2. Naming Consistency Audit
- Audited entire codebase for "zen" naming
- Result: **100% consistent** - all files, docs, and code use "zen"
- No alternative names or extensions found

### 3. Example Creation
Created two categories of examples:

#### Working Examples (Current Parser)
- `working_hello.zen` - Minimal program
- `working_variables.zen` - Variables and arithmetic  
- `working_loops.zen` - Conditional loops
- `working_functions.zen` - Basic functions

#### Specification Examples (Future Features)
- `zen_master_showcase.zen` - Complete language demonstration
- `01_hello_world.zen` - Hello world per spec
- `02_variables_and_types.zen` - Full variable system
- `03_pattern_matching.zen` - Pattern matching examples
- `04_loops.zen` - All loop patterns
- `05_structs_and_methods.zen` - Structs with UFCS

### 4. Documentation Updates
- Updated README.md to accurately reflect:
  - Current vs planned features
  - Working vs specification examples
  - Actual development status
- Created `.agent/global_memory.md` for state tracking

## Current Implementation Status

### Working âœ…
- Basic functions with `=` syntax
- Variables (`:=` and `::=`)
- Basic types (i32, f64, bool, etc.)
- Conditional loops
- Basic arithmetic/comparison
- LLVM code generation

### Not Yet Implemented ðŸš§
- Pattern matching with `?` operator
- Range expressions (`..`, `..=`)
- String interpolation `$(expr)`
- Loop iteration (`loop item in collection`)
- Module system (`@std` namespace)
- UFCS
- Behaviors/traits
- Compile-time (`comptime`)
- Error handling (Result/Option)

## Key Insights

1. **Parser Status**: Core features work, but many spec features pending
2. **Naming**: Already perfectly consistent throughout
3. **Examples**: Need two sets - working vs specification
4. **Documentation**: lang.md is comprehensive and well-designed

## Next Steps (Future Work)

1. Implement pattern matching with `?` operator
2. Add module system with `@std` namespace  
3. Implement range expressions and iteration
4. Add string interpolation
5. Complete UFCS implementation
6. Build standard library modules

## Files Modified/Created

- Created 10 new example files
- Updated README.md
- Created .agent/global_memory.md
- All changes committed to git

The zen language specification is well-designed and consistent. The implementation has a solid foundation with core features working. The main gap is between the specification and current implementation, which is now clearly documented.
