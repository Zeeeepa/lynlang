## Achievements üéØ

### Comptime Evaluation Engine Integration ‚úÖ
Successfully integrated the compile-time evaluation engine into the Lynlang compilation pipeline. The evaluator can now:
- Evaluate arithmetic expressions at compile time
- Handle comptime blocks and expressions
- Generate constants from compile-time computations
- Persist state across compilation phases (partial)

### Key Changes Made:
1. **LLVMCompiler Enhancement**
   - Added persistent `comptime_evaluator` field to maintain state
   - Updated expression compilation to use persistent evaluator
   - Proper error propagation instead of silent failures

2. **Comptime Integration**
   - Declaration-level comptime blocks now evaluated during compilation
   - Expression-level comptime blocks generate constants
   - Statement-level comptime blocks properly handled

3. **Testing & Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive comptime integration tests
   - Generated GitHub issue templates for tracking
   - Updated project meta-information in .agent directory

## Test Results üìä
- **Total Tests**: 93+ passing
- **Comptime Tests**: 7/7 unit tests passing
- **Integration Tests**: 2/4 passing (functions in comptime blocks need work)

## Next Steps üöÄ

### Immediate Priority: Generic Type Instantiation
This is the foundation for advanced features and should be tackled next:
- Design generic parameter representation in AST
- Build type instantiation engine  
- Implement monomorphization in LLVM codegen
- Add comprehensive test coverage

### Known Limitations:
- Comptime evaluator doesn't persist across all declaration boundaries
- Functions defined in comptime blocks not fully supported
- Need better integration with type system

## Code Quality Notes üìù
- Maintained 100% backward compatibility
- All existing tests still passing
- Clean separation of concerns
- Proper error handling throughout

## Zen Maintained ‚òØÔ∏è
The implementation follows Lynlang's principles:
- **Simplicity**: Straightforward integration without over-engineering
- **Elegance**: Clean API between evaluator and compiler
- **Practicality**: Focus on working features first
- **Intelligence**: Smart error propagation and fallback behavior

## Files Modified:
- `/src/codegen/llvm/mod.rs` - Added persistent evaluator
- `/src/codegen/llvm/expressions.rs` - Updated comptime expression handling  
- `/src/codegen/llvm/statements.rs` - Fixed comptime block evaluation
- `/tests/comptime_integration.rs` - New integration tests
- `/.agent/` - Updated project tracking files

The comptime evaluation engine is now integrated and functional for basic use cases. The foundation is solid for future enhancements.
