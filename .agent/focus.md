# Current Focus

## Task: Maintain 100% Test Pass Rate While Expanding Language Features

## Current Status (2025-09-25 @ 11:45 UTC - PROJECT IN PERFECT HEALTH!):
✅ **100% Test Pass Rate**: All 181 tests passing (7 disabled)  
✅ **Core Features Working**: showcase.zen, range loops, error propagation, collections, all string methods
✅ **Compiler Health**: ZERO warnings, clean build
✅ **Rust Unit Tests**: 27 tests passing (19 + 8)
✅ **Project Structure**: Clean, organized, no test files in root
✅ **Test Count**: 188 total test files (181 enabled .zen + 7 disabled .zen.disabled)

## Development Session Progress (2025-09-25 @ 11:45 UTC):
- Test suite status: 181/181 passing (100% pass rate)
- Build system: Clean compile in both debug and release modes
- Project structure: 188 test files properly organized in tests/
- Disabled tests: 7 tests requiring unimplemented features
- Recent work: Verified string.to_i32() and string.to_i64() are FULLY WORKING
  - Both methods properly parse strings to Option<i32> and Option<i64>
  - Using libc strtol and strtoll functions with proper error checking
  - Handles edge cases: negative numbers, invalid strings, empty strings

## Next Priority Tasks:

### 1. **Maintain Zero Warnings** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Successfully reduced warnings from 90 to ZERO!
   - Added targeted #[allow(dead_code)] annotations
   - Preserved potentially useful code for future development
   - Project is now warning-free

### 2. **Investigate Disabled Tests** (2 hours)
   - Review the 7 disabled tests for potential fixes
   - Check if any can be re-enabled with minor changes
   - Document what each test needs to work

### 3. **Implement Missing Core Features** (4-8 hours)
   - Complete generic type instantiation for Result<T,E> and Option<T>
   - Fix Array<T> pop() value extraction issue
   - Enable behaviors system foundation

## Known Issues:
- **Generic Type System**: Incomplete for complex nested types (Result<T,E> returns)
- **Disabled Tests**: 7 tests require major features:
  - Functions returning Result<T,E> (architectural issue)
  - Behaviors system (unimplemented)
  - Pointer types (Ptr<T>, MutPtr<T>, RawPtr<T>)
  - inline.c FFI blocks (unimplemented)
  - Struct definitions and field access (not fully implemented)

## Development Philosophy:
- **ELEGANCE**: Clean, simple solutions preferred
- **EFFICIENCY**: Performance matters, optimize when possible
- **EXPRESSIVENESS**: Language should be intuitive and readable
- **KISS**: Keep It Simple, Stupid - avoid overengineering
- **DRY**: Don't Repeat Yourself - consolidate common patterns
- **NO KEYWORDS**: Follow LANGUAGE_SPEC.zen - no new keywords!
