# Progress Report - 2025-08-27 Session

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed FFI Test Output Verification ✅
**Issue**: Tests were not actually verifying that printf/puts output appeared on stdout
**Solution**: 
- Created shared test utilities module (`tests/common/mod.rs`) following DRY principle
- Added `ExecutionHelper` and `CapturedOutput` classes for proper output verification
- Refactored all FFI tests to verify actual stdout output
- Added regex support for advanced output matching
- All 7 FFI tests now pass with proper verification

**Impact**: Tests now properly verify side effects instead of just generating IR

### 2. Project Analysis ✅
- Reviewed current state: 99.6% test pass rate (284/285 tests)
- Identified 1 failing test: `test_vec_with_pattern_matching`
- Project is at ~80% compiler completion with major parser improvements
- Self-hosted lexer, parser, stdlib written in Zen exist

## Current State

### Test Status
- **Total Tests**: 285
- **Passing**: 284 (99.6%)
- **Failing**: 1 (vector pattern matching test)

### Standard Library
Located in `/stdlib/` with Zen implementations:
- `vec.zen` - Vector/dynamic array implementation
- `hashmap.zen` - Hash map data structure
- `math.zen` - Mathematical functions
- `io.zen` - Input/output operations  
- `string.zen` - String utilities
- `mem.zen` - Memory management
- `algorithms.zen` - Common algorithms
- `collections.zen` - Data structures
- `core.zen` - Core types and utilities

### Compiler Features Working
- Basic types, functions, variables (mutable/immutable)
- Structs with field access
- Pattern matching with ? operator
- Basic generics with monomorphization
- C FFI (extern functions) with output verification
- Arrays (fixed-size)
- @std namespace with core/build/io/net modules
- Result<T,E> and Option<T> types
- String interpolation $(expr)
- Loops (condition, range, iterator)
- Comptime execution framework with interpreter
- Self-hosted lexer, parser, stdlib written in Zen
- Network module with TCP/UDP support

## Next Steps

1. **Expand Standard Library**
   - Add more vector operations (slice, filter, map)
   - Implement file I/O operations
   - Add string manipulation functions
   - Expand math library with trigonometric functions

2. **Self-Hosting Progress**
   - Complete self-hosted parser
   - Implement type checker in Zen
   - Work towards bootstrapping compiler

3. **Bug Fixes**
   - Fix the remaining vector pattern matching test
   - Clean up compiler warnings

4. **Documentation**
   - Update examples with working code
   - Document standard library APIs
