# Lynlang Active TODOs

## Completed Today (2025-08-24)
- [x] Verified pattern matching codegen is complete
- [x] Confirmed comptime evaluation engine is fully functional
- [x] Cleaned up all 90 compiler warnings
- [x] Verified all 219 tests passing (34 test suites)

## Completed Yesterday (2025-08-23)
- [x] Integrated generic types with LLVM codegen
- [x] Implemented monomorphization with type inference
- [x] Added two-pass compilation (declare then define)
- [x] Fixed struct literal parsing for generic structs
- [x] Fixed match expression parsing ambiguity

## Next Priority Features

### High Priority
- [ ] Array types with size [T; N]
- [ ] Improved enum variant handling
- [ ] Type alias support
- [ ] Advanced comptime features (type-level programming)

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Basic module system design
- [ ] Import/export implementation
- [ ] Standard library Vec implementation
- [ ] Standard library HashMap implementation
- [ ] C FFI implementation

### Low Priority
- [ ] Async/await design
- [ ] Closure implementation
- [ ] Macro system design
- [ ] Property-based testing framework

## Completed Core Features
- [x] Full parser for all language features
- [x] Pattern matching (parser + codegen)
- [x] Comptime evaluation engine
- [x] Generic type system with monomorphization
- [x] Type inference for generics
- [x] Behavior/trait system foundation
- [x] LLVM vtable generation
- [x] Range expressions
- [x] Member access chains

## Project Status
- All 219 tests passing
- Zero compiler warnings
- Parser: 100% complete
- Codegen: Core features complete
- Type system: Basic implementation working
- Comptime: Fully functional evaluator

## Notes
- Project is in excellent health
- Ready for next phase of feature development
- Consider implementing module system next for better code organization
