# Zen Language TODO List

## âœ… Completed
- [x] Fixed UTF-8 handling in lexer for proper Unicode support
- [x] Analyzed import system and comptime usage
- [x] Created .agent directory for project metadata
- [x] Verified imports work correctly outside comptime
- [x] Parser rejects imports in comptime blocks
- [x] Created zen-check validation tools
- [x] Tested import validation system
- [x] Fixed import system - imports now work at module level
- [x] Completed lexer implementation in Zen
- [x] Fixed stdlib syntax issues
- [x] Completed parser implementation with full language features
- [x] Implemented type checker with comprehensive type system
- [x] Created code generator supporting C and LLVM IR targets
- [x] Created full compiler test suite

## ðŸš§ In Progress
- [ ] Fix FFI tests that are failing
- [ ] Full bootstrap testing of self-hosting compiler

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. Bootstrap testing - compile the compiler with itself
2. Implement type checker in Zen
3. Port code generator to Zen
4. Bootstrap testing
5. Enhance LSP with full diagnostics
6. Performance optimization
7. Documentation updates

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Focus
Working on self-hosting compiler components:
- Lexer: COMPLETE (stdlib/compiler/lexer_enhanced.zen)
- Parser: COMPLETE (stdlib/compiler/parser.zen)
- Type checker: COMPLETE (stdlib/compiler/type_checker.zen)
- Code generator: COMPLETE (stdlib/compiler/code_gen.zen)
- Bootstrap testing: IN PROGRESS

Import system has been fixed - imports now work at module level as intended,
not inside comptime blocks.
