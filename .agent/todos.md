# Todo List

## Priority Order

### Immediate (Today)
1. [x] Fix import syntax - remove comptime wrapper requirement
2. [x] Enhance self-hosted parser and compiler
3. [x] Expand stdlib implementation in Zen
4. [x] Write comprehensive tests for stdlib and language features
5. [x] Review LSP server implementation

### Short-term (This Week)
6. [ ] Improve LSP server with more features
7. [ ] Fix failing language tests (struct methods, pattern matching)
8. [ ] Enhance type checker in self-hosted compiler
9. [ ] Add more stdlib modules (network, crypto enhancements)
10. [ ] Create integration test suite

### Medium-term
9. [ ] Port type checker to Zen
10. [ ] Enhance LSP server with more features
11. [ ] Add more stdlib modules (collections, algorithms)
12. [ ] Create comprehensive test coverage
