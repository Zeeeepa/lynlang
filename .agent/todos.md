# Zen Language TODO List

## âœ… Completed
- [x] Analyzed import system and comptime usage
- [x] Created .agent directory for project metadata
- [x] Verified imports work correctly outside comptime
- [x] Parser rejects imports in comptime blocks
- [x] Created zen-check validation tools
- [x] Tested import validation system
- [x] Fixed import system - imports now work at module level
- [x] Completed lexer implementation in Zen
- [x] Fixed stdlib syntax issues

## ðŸš§ In Progress
- [ ] Complete parser implementation in Zen (adding function declarations and if statements)

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. Complete parser implementation in Zen (95% done - needs function decls, if/else, loops)
2. Implement type checker in Zen
3. Port code generator to Zen
4. Bootstrap testing
5. Enhance LSP with full diagnostics
6. Performance optimization
7. Documentation updates

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Focus
Working on self-hosting compiler components:
- Lexer: COMPLETE (stdlib/compiler/lexer_enhanced.zen)
- Parser: 90% complete (stdlib/compiler/parser.zen)
- Type checker: Started (stdlib/compiler/type_checker.zen)
- Code generator: To be implemented

Import system has been fixed - imports now work at module level as intended,
not inside comptime blocks.
