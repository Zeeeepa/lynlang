# Progress Report - 2025-09-26

## Major Achievements

### Test Suite Improvements
- **Initial State**: 427/446 tests passing (95.7% pass rate) with 3 segfaults  
- **Final State**: 437/455 tests passing (96.0% pass rate) with 0 segfaults
- **Improvements**: +10 tests passing, all segfaults eliminated

### Critical Fixes

1. **Fixed Option Type Layout Mismatch** ✅
   - DynVec.get() was creating Option<T> with incorrect memory layout
   - Standard Option uses pointer for payload, DynVec was using direct value
   - Fixed by ensuring consistent Option struct layout across all uses
   - This eliminated the segfault in debug_dynvec_get.zen

2. **Fixed Test Runner** ✅
   - Test runner was incorrectly treating all non-zero exit codes as failures
   - Added support for expected exit codes for tests validating return values
   - Fixed 6 tests that were incorrectly marked as failing

3. **Cleaned Up LSP Implementation** ✅
   - Removed conflicting old LSP implementation using tower_lsp
   - Kept simpler lsp-server based implementation
   - Fixed compilation issues

## Current State

### What's Working Well
- ✅ NO-GC allocator system fully enforced
- ✅ Nested generics (Result<Option<T>,E> etc.)
- ✅ Pattern matching with arrow syntax
- ✅ DynVec, HashMap, Array with allocators
- ✅ String methods and parsing
- ✅ Import system from @std
- ✅ LSP binary compiles successfully

### Remaining Issues (18 failures)
- Internal Compiler Errors in several tests
- Method syntax on custom structs not implemented
- Type inference issues in some edge cases
- Parse errors in struct definitions

## Next Steps
1. Fix remaining Internal Compiler Errors
2. Complete LSP implementation with full features
3. Implement struct methods
4. Improve type inference for complex cases
