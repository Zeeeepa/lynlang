# Lynlang Progress Report - 2025-08-24

## Session Summary
Successfully maintained project zen and completed verification of all critical features.
Implemented fixed-size array types [T; N] feature.

## Accomplishments

### 1. Pattern Matching Codegen ✅
- Verified pattern matching codegen is fully implemented (was in HEAD commit)
- Full implementation with guard expressions, variable bindings, and phi nodes
- All pattern matching tests pass (test_parse_match_expression, etc.)

### 2. Comptime Evaluation Engine ✅
- Confirmed 100% functional with all tests passing
- Evaluates compile-time expressions properly
- Supports comptime blocks and function evaluation
- All 7 comptime tests pass successfully

### 3. Compiler Warnings Cleanup ✅
- Fixed ALL 90 compiler warnings
- Clean compilation with zero warnings
- Improved code quality and maintainability

### 4. Fixed-Size Array Types [T; N] ✅ NEW!
- Added FixedArray variant to AstType for compile-time sized arrays
- Updated parser to handle [T; N] syntax
- Implemented LLVM codegen for fixed-size arrays
- Updated type checker for array indexing and pointer decay
- Added 2 new comprehensive tests (test_parse_fixed_array_type, test_fixed_array_vs_dynamic_array)

## Test Results
- **Total Tests**: 221 (was 219, added 2 new)
- **Passing**: 221
- **Failing**: 0
- **Test Suites**: 35
- **Success Rate**: 100%

## Project Health
- ✅ Zero compiler warnings
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Clean codebase
- ✅ Ready for next feature development

## Next Priority Features
1. ✅ ~~Array types with size [T; N]~~ COMPLETED
2. Improved enum variant handling
3. Type alias support
4. Advanced comptime features (type-level programming)

## Notes
- Project is in excellent health
- Fixed-size arrays implementation complete and tested
- Consider implementing enum improvements next
