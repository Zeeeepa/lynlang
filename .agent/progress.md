# Progress Report

## Completed Today

### 1. Fixed Generic Struct Monomorphization ✅
- **Issue**: Generic structs weren't being monomorphized when instantiated with type inference
- **Root Cause**: The monomorphizer's `extract_generic_struct_types` always returned `None`
- **Solution**: 
  - Modified `collect_instantiations_from_expression` to infer types from field values
  - Added proper handling in `transform_expression` for struct literals
  - Fixed type inference to detect struct types properly
- **Result**: test_generic_struct_monomorphization_and_llvm now passes

### 2. Project Setup ✅
- Created .agent directory for tracking
- Established workflow for maintaining project state

## Test Status
- All tests passing (116 total)
- No regressions introduced

## Commits Made
- `783cf48`: fix: Generic struct monomorphization for type-inferred struct literals

## Next Priorities

1. **Comptime Evaluation Engine**
   - Build evaluation engine for compile-time expressions
   - Implement comptime function evaluation
   - Add comptime type-level programming support

2. **Code Cleanup**
   - Remove debug print statements
   - Fix compiler warnings
   - Apply cargo fix suggestions

3. **Pattern Matching Enhancements**
   - Ensure all pattern matching features work end-to-end
   - Add more comprehensive tests

## Technical Debt
- Some type inference is still simplified (takes first concrete type)
- Need proper type parameter matching for complex generic scenarios
- extract_generic_struct_types function stub needs implementation
