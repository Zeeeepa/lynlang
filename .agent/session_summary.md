# Lynlang Session Summary - 2025-08-23

## Session Achievements

### ✅ Completed Tasks
1. **Initialized .agent directory structure**
   - Created global_memory.md for state tracking
   - Created plan.md for development roadmap
   - Created todos.md for active task management

2. **Array Literal Support**
   - Implemented array literal parsing in expressions.rs
   - Added comprehensive tests (empty, single, multiple elements, trailing comma)
   - Verified codegen support exists (compile_array_literal)

3. **Code Quality Improvements**
   - Fixed unused variable warnings in LSP module
   - Fixed unused import in test-utils
   - Cleaned up test warnings

4. **Testing & Verification**
   - All 177 tests passing (up from 165)
   - Comptime evaluation working (19 tests)
   - Pattern matching codegen functional (5 tests)

5. **Commits Made**
   - "Add array literal parsing support and fix warnings"

## Current Project State

### Parser & Lexer ✅
- Feature-complete with all major constructs
- Pattern matching, comptime, member access, ranges all working
- Array literals now supported

### Codegen (LLVM) ⚠️
- Basic features working well
- Pattern matching: Basic implementation done
- Comptime: Evaluation engine working, integration partial
- Arrays: Literals and indexing partially done
- **Needs**: Complex patterns, full comptime integration, complete array ops

### Type System ⚠️
- Basic types implemented (i32, i64, f32, f64, bool, string, void)
- **Missing**: Generics, traits/behaviors, proper array types

## Next Priorities

### Immediate (Today/Tomorrow)
1. **Complete Array Implementation**
   - Fix array type in type system
   - Implement array methods (len, push, pop)
   - Add bounds checking
   - Write comprehensive tests

2. **Enhanced Pattern Matching**
   - Nested patterns
   - Guard conditions
   - Exhaustiveness checking

### High Priority (This Week)
3. **C FFI Enhancement**
   - Complete external function linking
   - C-compatible type mapping
   - Header generation

4. **Generic Type System**
   - Type parameters
   - Type instantiation
   - Monomorphization

### Medium Priority (Next Week)
5. **Module System**
   - Import/export syntax
   - Visibility modifiers
   - Namespace management

6. **Loop Constructs**
   - Unified loop syntax
   - Iterator support
   - Break/continue with labels

## Key Insights

### What's Working Well
- Parser is solid and feature-complete
- Test coverage is good (177 tests)
- Comptime evaluation engine is functional
- Pattern matching basics work

### Areas Needing Attention
- Type system needs major expansion
- Array implementation is incomplete
- Module system doesn't exist yet
- Many codegen features are stubs

### Recommendations
1. Focus on completing array implementation first (high value, partially done)
2. Then tackle C FFI (enables real programs)
3. Type system improvements should come next (foundation for everything else)
4. Keep test coverage high during development

## Repository Status
- Branch: ragemode
- 13 commits ahead of origin
- No uncommitted changes
- All tests passing

## Files Modified This Session
- src/parser/expressions.rs (array literal parsing)
- src/codegen/llvm/structs.rs (warning fix)
- src/lsp/mod.rs (warning fix)
- src/parser/enums.rs (warning fix)
- test-utils/src/lib.rs (unused import)
- tests/parser.rs (array literal tests)
- .agent/* (documentation)

## Time Estimate for Remaining Work
- Array completion: 2-3 hours
- Pattern matching enhancement: 3-4 hours
- C FFI completion: 4-6 hours
- Generic types: 8-12 hours
- Module system: 6-8 hours
- Full feature completion: 40-60 hours total

## Notes for Next Session
- Array implementation is the logical next step
- Consider implementing a simple standard library once C FFI works
- Documentation needs updating as features are completed
- Consider setting up CI/CD for automatic testing
