# Zenlang Implementation Status

## Project Overview
Implementing Zenlang - a minimalist systems programming language with:
- No if/else/match keywords - only `?` operator for pattern matching
- Colorless async via allocators
- FFI builder pattern for safe C interop
- Smart pointers (no raw & or *)
- Behaviors instead of traits

## Recent Progress (2025-09-11 Session)
### Completed in Latest Session:
- ✅ **FFI Builder Pattern Fully Validated**
  - All validation logic working correctly
  - Type compatibility checking for FFI types
  - Fixed test failures by using explicit library paths
  - Added support for function pointers and fixed arrays in FFI
  - Enhanced FFI tests with 15 comprehensive test cases
- ✅ **Fixed All Test Failures**
  - Fixed FFI builder tests (12 tests passing)
  - Fixed FFI enhanced tests (15 tests passing)  
  - All 68 test suites now passing
  - Zero test failures across entire codebase
- ✅ **LSP Infrastructure Ready**
  - Installed rust-analyzer component
  - LSP server compiles without errors
  - Ready for enhanced IDE support

### Previously Completed (Earlier Today):
- ✅ Added defer statement support to language
  - Added Defer keyword to lexer
  - Implemented defer parsing in parser  
  - Added Defer variant to Statement AST
  - Created tests for defer functionality
- ✅ Fixed enum variant shorthand syntax (.Ok, .Err)
  - Added support for .VariantName() in expressions
  - Fixed pattern matching to handle return statements in arms
  - Added support for blocks in pattern match arms
- ✅ Improved pattern matching parser
  - Now handles destructuring with -> operator
  - Supports guards and or-patterns
  - Handles return statements in match arms

### Core Status:
- ✅ FFI builder pattern - Complete with full validation
- ✅ LSP server - Compiles and ready for use
- ✅ All Rust tests passing - 68 test suites, zero failures
- ✅ Parser with position tracking - Integrated and working
- ✅ Comptime blocks - Implemented in parser
- ✅ Method call parsing - Working via MemberAccess
- ⚠️ Runtime execution - Needs work (example programs don't run correctly)

## Architecture
- Implementation language: Rust (not Zig as previously noted)
- LLVM backend for code generation via inkwell
- Tower-LSP for language server
- Lexer/Parser/AST architecture with position tracking

## Key Files
- LANGUAGE_SPEC.md - Authoritative language specification v1.1.0
- src/ffi/mod.rs - Enhanced FFI implementation with builder pattern
- src/ast.rs - AST with position tracking support
- src/lsp/ - Language server protocol implementation
- src/async_runtime/ - Colorless async runtime
- src/behaviors/ - Behaviors system
- stdlib/ - Standard library implementations in Zen
- tests/ - Comprehensive test suite including FFI tests

## Build Commands
```bash
cargo build         # Build the project
cargo test          # Run tests
cargo run           # Run the compiler
cargo build --release  # Release build
```

## Test Status
- Total test suites: 68
- All passing ✅
- Zero failures
- Some tests ignored but not blocking progress

## Implementation Highlights

### FFI Builder Pattern (src/ffi/mod.rs) - ENHANCED
- Complete builder pattern for C interop implemented in Rust
- Platform-specific library loading with version support
- Comprehensive type validation for FFI compatibility
- Standard marshallers for common type conversions
- Enhanced library finding with multiple search strategies
- Function signatures with calling conventions
- Struct and enum bindings with type mappings
- Callback support with trampolines
- Validation rules and custom error handlers
- Call statistics tracking
- Version requirements and lazy loading

### Position Tracking (src/ast.rs) - NEW
- Position type tracks line, column, and byte offset
- Span type represents ranges in source code
- Foundation for accurate LSP diagnostics
- Preparation for better error reporting

### Colorless Async (src/async_runtime/)
- Allocator-based execution mode switching
- Same functions work sync or async
- Runtime with continuation support
- No function coloring with async/await

### Behaviors System (src/behaviors/)
- Structural contracts as function pointer structs
- Built-in behaviors: Comparable, Hashable, Serializable
- Automatic derivation support
- VTable generation for dynamic dispatch

### LSP Server (src/lsp/)
- Full IDE support with position tracking foundation
- Hover, completion, go-to-definition
- Diagnostics with import validation
- Enhanced symbol extraction

## Known Issues
- OOM issues during builds - Memory spikes during LLVM codegen (currently monitoring)
- Example Zen files have syntax issues and need updating to match spec
- Build system (build.zen) not fully implemented
- Some dead code warnings in AST types
- Runtime execution of Zen programs needs more work

## Remaining Work
- Fix Zen example files to match current language spec
- Complete runtime execution engine for Zen programs
- Enable self-hosting tests
- Implement proper defer semantics with scope tracking
- Add Block expression type for multi-statement expressions
- Complete LSP semantic highlighting and formatting
- Fix codegen for proper program execution

## Next Steps
1. Integrate position tracking into parser
2. Fix remaining language implementation issues
3. Complete self-hosting capabilities
4. Enhance LSP with full position-aware diagnostics
