# Zenlang Implementation Status

## Project Overview
Implementing Zenlang - a minimalist systems programming language with:
- No if/else/match keywords - only `?` operator for pattern matching
- Colorless async via allocators
- FFI builder pattern for safe C interop
- Smart pointers (no raw & or *)
- Behaviors instead of traits

## Recent Progress
- FFI builder pattern implemented
- LSP partially implemented
- Core type system working
- Pattern matching with `?` operator functional

## Known Issues
- OOM issues during builds (need memory optimization)
- LSP has pending errors to fix
- Tests need completion
- Some language features from spec not yet implemented

## Key Files
- LANGUAGE_SPEC.md - Authoritative language specification v1.1.0
- src/compiler/ - Main compiler implementation
- src/lsp/ - Language server protocol implementation
- tests/ - Test suite

## Build Commands
```bash
zig build         # Build the project
zig build test    # Run tests
zig build run     # Run the compiler
```

## Architecture Notes
- Using Zig as implementation language
- LLVM backend for code generation
- Tree-sitter for syntax highlighting
