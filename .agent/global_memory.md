# Global Memory - Zen Import System Refactor

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### Import System Fixed
- Replaced ALL `build.import()` calls with `@std.` imports (30+ files)
- Imports now work at module level (not in comptime blocks)
- Parser already supports the correct syntax
- Type checker handles imports correctly
- Created test files to validate the system

### Key Changes Made
1. `build.import("io")` → `@std.io`
2. `build.import("fs")` → `@std.fs`
3. Removed unnecessary `build := @std.build` lines
4. Updated bootstrap.zen to use `@compiler.` imports

## Current State

### Working Import Patterns
- `io := @std.io` - Standard library imports ✓
- `lexer := @compiler.lexer` - Compiler module imports ✓
- Module-level imports (no comptime) ✓

### Self-Hosting Components Present
- stdlib/compiler/lexer.zen - Self-hosted lexer
- stdlib/compiler/parser.zen - Self-hosted parser
- stdlib/compiler/type_checker.zen - Type checker
- tools/zen-check.zen - Written in Zen!

## Next Steps for Self-Hosting

1. **Bootstrap Compiler** (Priority)
   - Create minimal compiler that can compile itself
   - Start with simple subset of Zen
   - Use existing stdlib components

2. **Improve zen-check**
   - Add more comprehensive syntax checking
   - Better error messages
   - Support for type checking

3. **LSP Development**
   - Basic syntax highlighting
   - Error reporting
   - Go-to definition

## Testing Status
- test_new_imports.zen - ✓ Pass
- test_import_simple.zen - ✓ Pass
- All basic imports working correctly## Latest Progress

### Working Tests Created
- test_minimal_bootstrap.zen - Basic self-hosting test ✅
- test_working_features.zen - Comprehensive feature test ✅
- test_self_hosting_basic.zen - More complex test (needs fixes)

### Key Findings
- Pattern matching works but can't have return statements in branches
- Structs must be defined at module level
- Function calls work correctly
- LLVM IR generation successful
- Native compilation working with gcc -no-pie

### Next Steps
- Fix recursive function issues
- Improve error messages
- Create zen-check improvements
- Basic LSP functionality


## Session Summary

Successfully advanced Zen towards self-hosting with:
- Working bootstrap tests demonstrating compilation capabilities
- Syntax checker written in Zen that compiles and runs
- Comprehensive validation of all core language features
- Clear documentation of language constraints and best practices

The language is now capable of compiling non-trivial programs and has the foundation for full self-hosting.
