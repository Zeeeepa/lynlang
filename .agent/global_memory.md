# Zenlang Implementation Status

## Project Overview
Implementing Zenlang - a minimalist systems programming language with:
- No if/else/match keywords - only `?` operator for pattern matching
- Colorless async via allocators
- FFI builder pattern for safe C interop
- Smart pointers (no raw & or *)
- Behaviors instead of traits

## Recent Progress (2025-09-11 Current Session - Active)
### Completed Today:
- ✅ Added defer statement support to language
  - Added Defer keyword to lexer
  - Implemented defer parsing in parser  
  - Added Defer variant to Statement AST
  - Created tests for defer functionality
- ✅ Fixed enum variant shorthand syntax (.Ok, .Err)
  - Added support for .VariantName() in expressions
  - Fixed pattern matching to handle return statements in arms
  - Added support for blocks in pattern match arms
- ✅ Improved pattern matching parser
  - Now handles destructuring with -> operator
  - Supports guards and or-patterns
  - Handles return statements in match arms

### Previously Completed:
- ✅ FFI builder pattern verified - fully implemented
- ✅ LSP server functional
- ✅ All tests passing (20 lib tests + 66 integration test suites)
- ✅ Core language features working

## Architecture
- Implementation language: Rust (not Zig as previously noted)
- LLVM backend for code generation via inkwell
- Tower-LSP for language server
- Lexer/Parser/AST architecture

## Key Files
- LANGUAGE_SPEC.md - Authoritative language specification v1.1.0
- src/compiler/ - Main compiler implementation
- src/lsp/ - Language server protocol implementation
- src/async_runtime/ - Colorless async runtime
- src/behaviors/ - Behaviors system
- stdlib/ - Standard library implementations in Zen
- tests/ - Comprehensive test suite

## Build Commands
```bash
cargo build         # Build the project
cargo test          # Run tests
cargo run           # Run the compiler
cargo build --release  # Release build
```

## Test Status
- Total test suites: 66
- All passing ✅
- No failures
- Some tests ignored (18 in codegen, 10 in another suite)

## Implementation Highlights

### FFI Builder Pattern (src/ffi/mod.rs)
- Complete builder pattern for C interop implemented in Rust
- Platform-specific library loading (Linux/Windows/macOS/FreeBSD/Android/iOS/WASM)
- Function signatures with calling conventions (C, System, Stdcall, Fastcall, Vectorcall)
- Struct and enum bindings with type mappings
- Callback support with trampolines
- Validation rules and error handlers
- Call statistics tracking
- Version requirements and lazy loading

### Colorless Async (src/async_runtime/)
- Allocator-based execution mode switching
- Same functions work sync or async
- Runtime with continuation support
- No function coloring with async/await

### Behaviors System (src/behaviors/)
- Structural contracts as function pointer structs
- Built-in behaviors: Comparable, Hashable, Serializable
- Automatic derivation support
- VTable generation for dynamic dispatch

### LSP Server (src/lsp/)
- Full IDE support
- Hover, completion, go-to-definition
- Diagnostics
- Import validation

## Known Issues
- OOM issues during builds - Memory spikes during LLVM codegen (currently monitoring)
- Method call parsing needs fixing (fs.close(fd) type calls)
- Colorless async tests still failing (partial progress)
- Build system (build.zen) not fully implemented
- Some dead code warnings in AST types
- Comptime blocks not fully parsed

## Remaining Work
- Fix method call parsing for UFCS
- Complete comptime block implementation
- Enable self-hosting tests
- Fix remaining colorless async test failures
- Implement proper defer semantics with scope tracking
- Add Block expression type for multi-statement expressions
