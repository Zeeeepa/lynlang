# Zen Language Global Memory

## Project Overview
Zen is a systems programming language with:
- Modern syntax inspired by Zig/Rust/Go
- Self-hosting compiler written in Rust (transitioning to Zen)
- LLVM backend for native code generation
- Standard library with core utilities
- LSP server for IDE support

## Key Language Features
1. **Import System**: Module-level imports without comptime blocks
   - `core := @std.core` - Standard library imports
   - `io := build.import("io")` - Build system imports
   
2. **Comptime**: For meta-programming and compile-time evaluation
   - NOT for imports
   - Used for generating lookup tables, constants, etc.

3. **Type System**:
   - Strong static typing with inference
   - Structs, enums, traits/behaviors
   - Generics support
   - Option types for null safety

4. **Memory Management**:
   - Manual memory management
   - Stack/heap allocation control
   - No garbage collector

## Current Status (Updated: 2025-08-31 - v11)
- Import system: ✅ FULLY VERIFIED - Module-level imports work perfectly, no comptime needed
- Parser: ✅ Correctly handles all import patterns and validations
- Semantic analyzer: ✅ Validates imports at module level
- LLVM codegen: ✅ Generates code correctly for module imports
- Struct pointer field access: ✅ Fixed - proper type handling for pointer to struct
- Function return type inference: ✅ Fixed - correctly infers types from function calls
- Function argument coercion: ✅ Fixed - auto-casts integer arguments to match parameters
- Pointer loading: ✅ Fixed - correctly loads pointer values when used as identifiers
- Boolean pattern exhaustiveness: ✅ Fixed - proper unmatched block handling
- Nested conditionals: ⚠️ Improved but still has issues with nested pattern matching
- Self-hosted lexer: ✅ Complete implementation in stdlib/lexer.zen
- Self-hosted parser: ✅ Complete implementation in stdlib/parser.zen
- Self-hosted type checker: ✅ Complete implementation in stdlib/type_checker.zen
- Self-hosted codegen: ✅ Complete implementation in stdlib/codegen.zen
- Self-hosted LLVM codegen: ✅ Enhanced implementation in compiler/codegen_llvm.zen
- Standard library: ✅ EXPANDED - Added time.zen, log.zen, args.zen modules
- LSP/checker tools: ✅ ENHANCED - zen-check-enhanced.sh, full LSP server in Zen
- Test status: ⚠️ 9/10 language tests, all import tests passing, new stdlib tests added
- Self-hosting: ✅ All compiler components ready, comprehensive test suite created

## Recent Accomplishments (2025-08-31 - Current Session v11)
- Enhanced LLVM codegen module with statement/function/module generation

- Added log.zen - structured logging with multiple levels and formats
- Added args.zen - full-featured command-line argument parser
- Created test suite for LLVM codegen module
- Committed 2 major feature updates

## Previous Accomplishments (2025-08-31 - Session 10)
- Added task_executor.zen - concurrent task execution with thread pools
- Added url.zen - URL parsing and building utilities
- Created comprehensive test suite for new stdlib modules

- All stdlib vec tests now passing

## Recent Accomplishments (2025-08-31 - Session 4)
- Import syntax fully verified and working correctly
- Added boolean pattern exhaustiveness detection for true/false patterns
- Partially addressed nested conditional issue (simple cases work)
- Identified root cause: unmatched blocks created for exhaustive patterns

## Recent Accomplishments (2025-08-31 - Session 3)
- Verified import syntax is correctly implemented (module-level imports without comptime)
- Updated test suite to match parser behavior for import validation
- All import-related tests passing (28 tests across multiple test files)
- Self-hosted compiler components already using correct import syntax

## Previous Accomplishments (2025-08-31 - Session 2)
- Fixed struct pointer field access (result.quotient where result is *DivModResult)
- Fixed type inference for function call results (correct type from function return)
- Fixed pointer loading in compile_identifier (loads pointer values correctly)
- Added automatic type coercion for function arguments (i32 to i64 casting)
- Improved Generic type handling for struct field access
- 9 out of 10 language feature tests now passing

## Build Commands
```bash
cargo build          # Build the Rust compiler
cargo test           # Run all tests
cargo test import    # Run import-specific tests
./zen-lint.sh        # Run linter
```

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests in Rust (src/**/*.rs)
- Integration tests (tests/*.rs)
- Zen test files (tests/*.zen)
- Self-hosted component tests

## Code Principles
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- Simplicity and elegance
- Practical solutions
