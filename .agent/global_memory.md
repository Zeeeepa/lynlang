# Zenlang Implementation Status

## Project Overview
Implementing Zenlang - a minimalist systems programming language with:
- No if/else/match keywords - only `?` operator for pattern matching
- Colorless async via allocators
- FFI builder pattern for safe C interop
- Smart pointers (no raw & or *)
- Behaviors instead of traits

## Recent Progress (2025-09-11)
- ✅ FFI builder pattern fully implemented in stdlib/ffi.zen
- ✅ LSP server implemented and working (src/lsp/)
- ✅ Colorless async runtime implemented (src/async_runtime/)
- ✅ Behaviors system implemented (src/behaviors/)
- ✅ Range patterns implemented (0..10, 0..=10)
- ✅ Type patterns with binding implemented (i32 -> n)
- ✅ Guard patterns implemented (v -> v > 100)
- ✅ Fixed compiler warnings in async_runtime and behaviors
- ✅ All tests passing (200+ tests across all suites)

## Architecture
- Implementation language: Rust (not Zig as previously noted)
- LLVM backend for code generation via inkwell
- Tower-LSP for language server
- Lexer/Parser/AST architecture

## Key Files
- LANGUAGE_SPEC.md - Authoritative language specification v1.1.0
- src/compiler/ - Main compiler implementation
- src/lsp/ - Language server protocol implementation
- src/async_runtime/ - Colorless async runtime
- src/behaviors/ - Behaviors system
- stdlib/ - Standard library implementations in Zen
- tests/ - Comprehensive test suite

## Build Commands
```bash
cargo build         # Build the project
cargo test          # Run tests
cargo run           # Run the compiler
cargo build --release  # Release build
```

## Test Status
- Total test suites: 66
- All passing ✅
- No failures
- Some tests ignored (18 in codegen, 10 in another suite)

## Implementation Highlights

### FFI Builder Pattern (stdlib/ffi.zen)
- Complete builder pattern for C interop
- Platform-specific library loading (Linux/Windows/macOS)
- Function signatures with calling conventions
- Struct bindings
- Memory helpers (C string conversion)

### Colorless Async (src/async_runtime/)
- Allocator-based execution mode switching
- Same functions work sync or async
- Runtime with continuation support
- No function coloring with async/await

### Behaviors System (src/behaviors/)
- Structural contracts as function pointer structs
- Built-in behaviors: Comparable, Hashable, Serializable
- Automatic derivation support
- VTable generation for dynamic dispatch

### LSP Server (src/lsp/)
- Full IDE support
- Hover, completion, go-to-definition
- Diagnostics
- Import validation

## Known Issues
- OOM issues during builds (need memory optimization) - Still present but manageable
- Some advanced pattern matching features not fully implemented
- Build system (build.zen) not fully implemented

## Next Steps
- Implement remaining pattern matching features
- Complete build system
- Optimize memory usage in LLVM codegen
- Add more comprehensive stdlib
