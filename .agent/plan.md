# Zenlang Implementation Plan

## Current Status (2025-09-11)
✅ FFI Builder Pattern - COMPLETE
✅ LSP Implementation - FUNCTIONAL  
✅ Core Tests - PASSING
⚠️  67 tests marked as ignored (pending features)

## Completed Today
1. ✅ Implemented FFI version checking logic
2. ✅ Completed callback initialization with validation
3. ✅ Enhanced callback registration with safety checks
4. ✅ Fixed compilation errors in FFI module
5. ✅ Verified LSP server builds successfully
6. ✅ All active tests passing (100+ tests)

## Priority Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Core Language Features (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Pattern matching comprehensive implementation
  - [ ] Simple value patterns
  - [ ] Range patterns  
  - [ ] Enum destructuring
  - [ ] Guard patterns
  - [ ] Multiple patterns (or-patterns)
  - [ ] Type patterns
  - [ ] Struct destructuring (NO TUPLES)
  
### Phase 2: Async System (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- [ ] Colorless async via allocators
  - [ ] Allocator trait definition
  - [ ] Sync/async execution modes
  - [ ] Channel implementation
  - [ ] Actor pattern
  - [ ] Thread spawning

### Phase 3: Standard Library (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- [ ] Complete @std namespace implementation
- [ ] Core modules (io, mem, collections)
- [ ] Math and string utilities
- [ ] File system operations
- [ ] Networking support

### Phase 4: Testing & Polish (LOW PRIORITY)
- [ ] Enable and fix ignored tests
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Documentation generation

## Architecture Notes
- LLVM backend for code generation
- Tower-LSP for language server
- Builder patterns throughout for safety
- No lifetime annotations - smart pointers only
- No raw pointers except for FFI

## Known Issues to Address
- Memory usage during builds (OOM reported)
- 124 warnings in release build
- 67 ignored tests need implementation

## Next Steps
1. Implement pattern matching comprehensively
2. Enable colorless async system
3. Complete standard library modules
4. Fix all ignored tests
5. Optimize build memory usage
