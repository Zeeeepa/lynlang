# Zen Self-Hosting Development Plan

## Vision: Self-Hosted Zen Compiler by 2026

The goal is to replace the current Rust-based Zen compiler with a Zen-based compiler that can compile itself. This represents the maturity milestone for the language.

## Three-Phase Approach

### Phase 1: Language Foundation (Q4 2025 - Q1 2026)
**Goal**: Complete language implementation to support basic programs

#### Core Missing Features
1. **Struct System Completion** (4-6 weeks)
   - Complete struct field access codegen 
   - Struct instantiation with named fields
   - Mutable field updates
   - Memory layout optimization
   - **Success Metric**: All struct examples in lang.md compile and run

2. **Pattern Matching Implementation** (4-6 weeks)  
   - Complete `?` operator codegen for all patterns
   - Destructuring assignment support
   - Guard clause implementation
   - **Success Metric**: Replace all if/else with `?` operator in compiler

3. **Generic System** (6-8 weeks)
   - Complete generic instantiation (monomorphization)
   - Support for `Option<T>`, `Result<T,E>`, `Array<T>`
   - Generic function compilation
   - **Success Metric**: Fully functional generic collections

4. **Module System** (3-4 weeks)
   - `build.import()` functionality
   - Module resolution and loading
   - Namespace management
   - **Success Metric**: Multi-file Zen programs work

**Phase 1 Deliverable**: Zen can compile moderately complex programs with data structures, generics, and multiple modules.

### Phase 2: Standard Library (Q1 - Q2 2026)  
**Goal**: Build essential standard library for practical programming

#### Critical Standard Library Components
1. **Memory Management** (4-6 weeks)
   - `Ptr<T>` and `Ref<T>` implementation
   - Basic allocator interface
   - Memory safety abstractions
   - **Success Metric**: Manual memory management works safely

2. **Core Collections** (6-8 weeks)
   - `Array<T>` with bounds checking
   - `List<T>` dynamic array
   - `Map<K,V>` hash table
   - Iterator protocols
   - **Success Metric**: Can build complex data structures

3. **String System** (3-4 weeks) 
   - String interpolation `$(expr)` 
   - String manipulation functions
   - UTF-8 support
   - **Success Metric**: Rich text processing capabilities

4. **IO & System Interface** (4-5 weeks)
   - Enhanced file operations
   - Process management
   - Environment interface
   - **Success Metric**: Can build command-line tools

**Phase 2 Deliverable**: Zen has a working standard library suitable for system programming tasks.

### Phase 3: Self-Hosting Implementation (Q2 - Q3 2026)
**Goal**: Port the Rust compiler to Zen

#### Compiler Architecture in Zen
1. **Lexer/Parser Port** (8-10 weeks)
   - Port tokenization logic from Rust
   - Implement recursive descent parser in Zen
   - Error recovery and diagnostics
   - **Success Metric**: Can parse all valid Zen code

2. **Type System Port** (6-8 weeks)
   - Port type checking logic
   - Implement type inference
   - Generic instantiation
   - **Success Metric**: Proper type checking for all Zen features

3. **Code Generation** (8-12 weeks)
   - Either LLVM FFI bindings or custom backend
   - Optimization passes
   - Debug information generation  
   - **Success Metric**: Generates equivalent code to Rust version

4. **Build System Integration** (4-6 weeks)
   - Module compilation coordination
   - Dependency management
   - Incremental compilation
   - **Success Metric**: Efficient build times

**Phase 3 Deliverable**: `zen-compiler.zen` can compile itself and all Zen programs.

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Methodology
- **Test-Driven Development**: Every feature has comprehensive tests
- **Incremental Rollout**: Features developed in isolated branches
- **Working Examples**: Each feature demonstrated with practical examples
- **Documentation First**: Spec-compliant implementation following lang.md

### Risk Management
- **Dual Compiler Strategy**: Rust compiler remains functional during transition
- **Feature Gates**: New features behind flags until proven stable
- **Incremental Bootstrap**: Start with minimal self-hosted compiler, grow features
- **Rollback Plan**: Can fall back to Rust compiler if needed

### Success Metrics by Phase

#### Phase 1 Success Criteria
- [ ] All examples in `examples/` directory compile and run
- [ ] Can write 1000+ line Zen programs
- [ ] Data structures and generics fully functional
- [ ] Module system enables code organization

#### Phase 2 Success Criteria  
- [ ] Can implement non-trivial algorithms (sorting, searching, parsing)
- [ ] Standard library comparable to other systems languages
- [ ] Performance competitive with C/Rust for system tasks
- [ ] Memory management prevents common security issues

#### Phase 3 Success Criteria
- [ ] Self-hosted compiler compiles itself successfully
- [ ] Generated code performance matches Rust version
- [ ] Build times reasonable for development workflow
- [ ] All existing tests pass with self-hosted compiler

## Resource Requirements

### Development Time Estimate
- **Phase 1**: 4-6 months (foundation)
- **Phase 2**: 3-4 months (standard library)  
- **Phase 3**: 6-8 months (self-hosting)
- **Total**: ~12-18 months for complete self-hosting

### Key Dependencies
- LLVM integration strategy decision
- Standard library design choices
- Memory management model finalization
- Build system architecture

## Competitive Advantage

### Why Self-Hosting Matters
1. **Language Maturity**: Demonstrates Zen is ready for production use
2. **Developer Experience**: Zen developers use Zen tools
3. **Performance Validation**: Self-hosted compiler proves language efficiency
4. **Community Building**: Shows commitment to long-term language support

### Differentiation from Rust/C++
- **Simpler Syntax**: Minimal keywords, composable operators
- **Better Error Handling**: Explicit Result types, no exceptions
- **Powerful Metaprogramming**: Compile-time computation and code generation
- **Modern Design**: No legacy baggage, clean slate approach

## Next Steps (Immediate Actions)

### Week 1-2: Foundation Setup
1. Complete struct field access codegen (highest impact)
2. Create comprehensive test suite for structs  
3. Implement struct instantiation syntax
4. Add working struct examples to examples/

### Week 3-4: Pattern Matching
1. Begin `?` operator codegen implementation
2. Support basic conditional patterns first
3. Add destructuring assignment support
4. Replace existing if/else usage in compiler

This plan provides a clear path to self-hosting while maintaining development momentum and avoiding major risks. The incremental approach ensures we can always fall back to a working compiler while building toward the ultimate goal.
