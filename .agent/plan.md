# Zenlang Implementation Plan

## Current Status
- FFI builder pattern: ✅ COMPLETE (fully implemented with advanced features)
- LSP: ⚠️ Partially implemented, needs completion
- Core language features: ⚠️ Many implemented, some missing
- Tests: ✅ 68 tests passing

## Priority Tasks
1. Complete LSP implementation
2. Implement missing language features from spec:
   - Colorless async via allocators
   - Complete behaviors system
   - Complete pattern matching with all features
3. Add comprehensive test coverage
4. Optimize memory usage

## Language Features Status
### Complete ✅
- Basic types (primitives)
- Functions
- Structs
- Enums  
- Pattern matching (basic)
- FFI builder pattern
- Comptime (basic)

### Partial ⚠️
- Behaviors (basic structure exists)
- LSP (basic server works)
- Pattern matching (missing some advanced patterns)
- Module system

### Not Implemented ❌
- Colorless async (allocator-based)
- Advanced pattern matching features
- Complete stdlib
- Build system (build.zen)

## Memory Issues
- Need to optimize LLVM code generation
- Consider lazy compilation
- Implement incremental compilation
