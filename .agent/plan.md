# Zen Language - Development Plan

## Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
✅ Language specification v1.0
✅ Basic compiler implementation (55%)
✅ Core stdlib modules
✅ Testing infrastructure  
✅ GitHub CI/CD (LLVM 18.1)

## Phase 2: Self-Hosting (In Progress)
🚧 Complete self-hosted lexer (90% → 100%)
🚧 Complete self-hosted parser (25% → 100%)
⏳ Implement type checker in Zen
⏳ Implement code generator in Zen
⏳ Bootstrap process

## Phase 3: Production Ready
- [ ] Full stdlib implementation
- [ ] Package manager (zen-pkg)
- [ ] Documentation generator
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Performance optimizations

## Phase 4: Ecosystem
- [ ] LSP full implementation
- [ ] IDE plugins (VS Code, Vim, Emacs)
- [ ] Build system integration
- [ ] Community packages
- [ ] Web playground

## Technical Roadmap

### Immediate (This Week)
1. Fix parser test hanging issues
2. Complete missing test scripts
3. Enhance error diagnostics
4. Progress on self-hosted parser

### Short-term (This Month)
1. Complete self-hosted compiler
2. Initial bootstrap attempt
3. Package manager design
4. Documentation improvements

### Long-term (Q1 2025)
1. Full self-hosting achieved
2. Production-ready compiler
3. Rich ecosystem tools
4. Community launch

## Success Metrics
- 100% test pass rate ✅
- Self-hosted compiler working
- < 1s compile time for 1000 LOC
- Zero memory leaks
