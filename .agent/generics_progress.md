# Generic Type System Improvements Summary

## Changes Made:
1. Fixed nested generic struct handling in pattern matching
2. Added support for struct values in PHI nodes (fixed panic)
3. Enhanced raise() for nested generic extraction
4. Fixed pattern matching to use qualified enum names

## Test Results:
- Overall: 265/292 tests passing (90.8%)
- Failures: 27 (including 7 segfaults)
- Progress: Fixed critical nested generics issues

## Key Achievements:
- Triple-nested generics (Result<Result<Result<T,E>,E>,E>) now working
- Pattern matching on nested enums functional
- raise() correctly extracts nested types
- Fixed panic in LLVM codegen for struct values

## Remaining Issues:
- 27 tests still failing (need investigation)
- Some tests have i64 type issues with raise()
- Generic monomorphization needs improvement
