# Engine-SDK Consistency Fix Summary

## What Was Fixed

### Critical Issue
The Zen compiler had major inconsistencies between the "engine" (Rust stdlib modules in `src/stdlib/`) and "SDK" (Zen stdlib modules in `stdlib/`). This prevented the standard library from functioning properly.

### Solutions Implemented

1. **Missing Module Registration** ✅
   - Created `src/stdlib/build.rs` to fix missing build module
   - Added math, string, vec, fs module implementations
   - Registered all modules in StdNamespace

2. **Core Module Alignment** ✅
   - Added utility functions to match SDK implementation
   - Fixed Result/Option type definitions
   - Maintained compiler intrinsics

3. **Module Resolution** ✅
   - Updated resolve_std_access to recognize 30+ modules
   - All @std.module references now resolve correctly

## Impact
- Standard library modules are now accessible
- Type system has consistent Result/Option definitions
- Foundation laid for complete stdlib implementation

## Next Steps
1. Implement remaining stdlib modules (net, json, regex, etc.)
2. Fix IO module abstraction level mismatch
3. Add LLVM codegen for intrinsic functions
4. Create execution tests for stdlib functions
