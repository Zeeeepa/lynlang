# Zen Language Development Scratchpad
## Session Date: 2025-08-31

## Current Focus
- Import syntax has been fixed (no more comptime wrappers for imports)
- Moving forward with self-hosting implementation
- Need to enhance stdlib and testing

## Import Syntax Status
✅ COMPLETE - All files updated to use direct imports:
```zen
// CORRECT (what we have now)
core := @std.core
build := @std.build
io := build.import("io")

// WRONG (what we removed)
comptime {
    core := @std.core
}
```

## Test Results
- Zen tests: 16/16 passing ✅
- Rust tests: 7/10 passing (3 failures in language features)
  - test_multiple_return_values
  - test_nested_pattern_matching  
  - test_struct_with_methods

## Next Priority Tasks
1. Fix Rust test failures (compiler bugs)
2. Enhance self-hosted parser for better error handling
3. Create more stdlib modules in pure Zen
4. Improve type checker
5. Add more comprehensive tests

## Technical Notes
- Comptime is now properly used only for metaprogramming
- Parser can handle both regular imports and @builtin imports
- Self-hosted components are mostly functional
- Need to focus on stability and test coverage

## Git Strategy
- Commit frequently with clear messages
- Current branch: master
- Last status: clean
