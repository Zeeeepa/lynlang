# Scratchpad - Session Notes

## Session Summary (2025-08-31)

### Completed Tasks
1. ✅ **Import Syntax**: Verified that imports work without comptime wrapper
2. ✅ **Self-Hosted Parser**: Enhanced with module-level import handling
3. ✅ **Stdlib Enhancement**: Added comprehensive test framework
4. ✅ **Project Organization**: Created .agent directory structure
5. ✅ **LSP Implementation**: Created basic LSP with diagnostics

### Key Achievements
- Parser now correctly handles `core := @std.core` and `io := build.import("io")` patterns
- Test framework with assertions, suites, setup/teardown, and benchmarks
- Basic LSP server for syntax checking and diagnostics
- All import-related tests passing

### Known Issues
- Some language feature tests failing (generics, nested patterns) - not related to imports
- These are existing compiler limitations, not regressions

### Next Steps
- Enhance self-hosted lexer with full tokenization
- Port more compiler components to Zen
- Expand stdlib with collections and algorithms
- Add more LSP features (hover, go-to-definition, completions)
- Create comprehensive test coverage for all stdlib modules

### Git Status
- 23 commits ahead of origin/master
- All changes committed
- Ready for push when appropriate
