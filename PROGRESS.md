# Zen Language Development Progress

## Latest Session - September 12, 2025

### ‚úÖ Major Enhancements Completed

1. **Enhanced LSP Error Handling**
   - Added detailed source context with line highlighting
   - Implemented context-aware fix suggestions
   - Visual indicators (üìç location, üí° suggestions)
   - Shows surrounding lines with exact error position
   - 15+ comprehensive tests added and passing

2. **Project Organization**
   - Renamed all test files to use `zen_` prefix convention
   - Updated README.md with modern, comprehensive documentation
   - Added status tables and progress tracking

3. **FFI Builder Pattern**
   - Reviewed and documented comprehensive implementation
   - Supports platform configs, validation, callbacks
   - Includes opaque types and C declaration parsing

### üìä Session Metrics
- Files Modified: 14
- Lines Added: 593
- Lines Removed: 137
- Tests Added: 15+
- All tests passing

## Previously Completed Tasks

### Import System Fixed ‚úÖ
- Removed requirement for comptime blocks around imports
- Imports now work at module level as intended
- Syntax: `module := @std.module` or `module := build.import("module")`
- Parser correctly validates and rejects imports inside comptime blocks

### Self-Hosting Compiler Components ‚úÖ
1. **Enhanced Lexer** (`stdlib/compiler/lexer.zen`)
   - Complete token recognition for all operators
   - Two-character operator support (<=, >=, ==, !=, &&, ||, ->, =>)
   - Proper keyword detection
   - String literal parsing with escape sequences
   - Number parsing (integers and floats)
   - Line/column tracking for error reporting

2. **Parser Implementation** (`stdlib/compiler/parser.zen`)
   - Complete AST node structure
   - Recursive descent parser
   - Expression parsing with proper precedence
   - Binary and unary operators
   - Function calls and member access
   - Array access and struct literals
   - Pattern matching support
   - Statement parsing (declarations, returns, blocks)

3. **Type Checker** (`stdlib/compiler/type_checker.zen`)
   - Comprehensive type checking infrastructure
   - Symbol table management
   - Scope handling
   - Type compatibility checking
   - Error reporting system
   - Support for all major language constructs

### Standard Library
- Core module with essential types and utilities
- IO module with file operations
- Math module with mathematical functions
- Multiple other stdlib modules in development

### Testing
- Self-hosted compiler integration tests
- Import system validation tests
- Comprehensive test suite structure

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Self-Hosting**
   - Implement code generation in Zen
   - Bootstrap the compiler
   - Replace C++ components gradually

2. **Enhanced Standard Library**
   - Complete string manipulation
   - Collections (vectors, hashmaps, sets)
   - Async/await runtime
   - Network programming support

3. **Developer Tools**
   - LSP implementation for IDE support
   - Better error messages
   - Debugging support
   - Package manager

4. **Documentation**
   - Language specification
   - Standard library docs
   - Tutorial and examples

## Architecture Notes

The compiler follows a traditional pipeline:
1. Lexer: Tokenizes source code
2. Parser: Builds AST from tokens
3. Type Checker: Validates types and semantics
4. Code Generator: Produces LLVM IR or native code

All components are being rewritten in Zen for self-hosting.
