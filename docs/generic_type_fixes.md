# Generic Type System Fixes

## Issues Found

1. **Generic Context Pollution Across Functions** - FIXED
   - Generic type context was not cleared between function calls
   - Fix: Clear generic_type_context and reset generic_tracker after each function

2. **Generic Context Pollution Within Functions** - ACTIVE ISSUE
   - When processing multiple Result/Option types in the same function, the generic context gets overwritten
   - Example: Result<string>.Ok() sets Result_Ok_Type to String, then Result<i32>.Ok() still uses String type
   - This causes integer payloads to be interpreted as string pointers, leading to corruption

## Solution Needed

We need to scope the generic type context per expression rather than per function. Options:

1. **Save/Restore Context**: Before compiling each Result/Option construction, save the current context and restore it after
2. **Expression-Level Context**: Create a new context for each expression tree
3. **Unique Keys**: Use unique keys for each Result/Option instance based on location/counter

## Implementation Status

- ✅ Fixed cross-function pollution by clearing context after each function
- ✅ Result<Option<T>> works correctly  
- ✅ Option<Result<T>> works correctly
- ❌ Result<Result<T>> via variables doesn't work
- ❌ Mixed Result<string> and Result<i32> in same function causes corruption
- ❌ Triple-nested generics have issues

## Test Results

Working:
- Direct inline construction of nested types
- Single type per function
- Function returns when not mixed with other types

Failing:
- Multiple different Result types in same function
- Result stored in variables then used as nested payload
- Complex nested scenarios with 3+ levels
