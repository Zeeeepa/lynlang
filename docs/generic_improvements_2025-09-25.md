# Generic Type System Improvements

## Status Report - 2025-09-25

### Summary
Successfully improved generic type handling for nested Result and Option types. The LLVM codegen layer now properly tracks and preserves generic type information through nested enum compilations.

### Key Improvements

1. **Context Save/Restore for Nested Generics**
   - Added mechanism to save and restore generic type context during nested enum compilation
   - Prevents inner Result<T,E> from overwriting outer Result type information
   - Enables proper type tracking for variables containing Result<Result<T,E>,E>

2. **Enhanced Variable Type Inference** 
   - Variables assigned from raise() now correctly infer nested Result types
   - Improved Last_Raise_Extracted_Type tracking for complex generic payloads
   - LLVM compiler correctly tracks: outer = Result<Result<I32, String>, String>

3. **Heap Allocation Preservation**
   - Nested Result/Option types properly heap-allocated and dereferenced
   - Payload extraction maintains correct type information through multiple levels

### Test Results
- Re-enabled test_raise_nested_result.zen - now passing
- Test suite: 231/236 tests passing (97.9% pass rate) 
- Improved from previous 230/235 (97.8%)

### Remaining Limitations

1. **Type Checker/Compiler Desync**
   - Type checker and LLVM compiler have separate type tracking systems
   - Type checker does not yet fully support nested generics
   - test_raise_simple_nested.zen still fails due to type checker limitations

2. **Pattern Matching Payload Extraction**
   - Nested pattern matching extracts 0 instead of actual values in some cases
   - Root cause: stack vs heap allocation handling for nested payloads

3. **Architectural Issues**
   - Full resolution requires unified type system between typechecker and compiler
   - Generic monomorphization not yet implemented

### Next Steps
1. Unify type tracking between type checker and LLVM compiler
2. Implement proper generic monomorphization
3. Fix remaining payload extraction issues for deeply nested types
