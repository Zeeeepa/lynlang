# Generic Type System Improvements

## Date: 2025-09-26

### Summary
Significantly improved the generic type system hardening by fixing multiple type inference issues in the compiler's `infer_expression_type()` function.

### Key Achievements
- **Test Pass Rate Improved**: From 77.3% to 82.6% (+5.3% improvement)
- **Tests Passing**: 247 out of 299 tests now passing
- **Zero Segfaults**: All failures are compilation errors, no runtime crashes

### Fixes Implemented

#### 1. Struct Literal Type Inference
- **Problem**: Struct literals were returning void type
- **Solution**: Added proper type inference for `Expression::StructLiteral`
- **Impact**: Enabled struct initialization to work correctly

#### 2. Generic Constructor Type Inference
- **Problem**: `Vec<T, N>()`, `DynVec<T>()`, and `Array<T>()` constructors returned void
- **Solution**: Added type inference for:
  - `Expression::VecConstructor`
  - `Expression::DynVecConstructor`
  - `Expression::ArrayConstructor`
- **Impact**: Generic collections can now be properly instantiated

#### 3. String Interpolation Type Inference
- **Problem**: String interpolation expressions returned void
- **Solution**: Added type inference for `Expression::StringInterpolation`
- **Impact**: String interpolation now correctly returns String type

#### 4. Type Cast Expression Inference
- **Problem**: Type cast expressions (using `as`) returned void
- **Solution**: Added type inference for `Expression::TypeCast`
- **Impact**: Type casts now properly return the target type

#### 5. Closure Type Inference
- **Problem**: Closures were not handled in type inference
- **Solution**: Added proper closure return type inference
- **Impact**: Closures returning Result<T,E> or Option<T> now work correctly

#### 6. Loop and Control Flow Type Inference
- **Problem**: Loop, Return, Break, Continue expressions had no type inference
- **Solution**: Added appropriate type inference for control flow expressions
- **Impact**: Better handling of complex control flow in generic contexts

### Remaining Issues
- Some nested generic payload extraction still needs work
- Disabled tests still require:
  - Behavior/trait system implementation
  - Pointer type support
  - LSP features
  - Complex collection operations

### Technical Details
All fixes were made to the `infer_expression_type()` method in `src/codegen/llvm/expressions.rs`. This method is crucial for the compiler's type system as it determines what type an expression will evaluate to, which is essential for:
- Variable type inference
- Generic type instantiation
- Pattern matching
- Method resolution
- Error propagation

### Next Steps
1. Continue improving nested generic type handling
2. Work on enabling more disabled tests
3. Implement missing stdlib features
4. Further harden the type system for edge cases
