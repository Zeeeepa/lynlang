# Zen Language Implementation Report

## Executive Summary
The Zen language compiler has been updated to support basic features from LANGUAGE_SPEC.zen. Key improvements include parsing and compilation of `@std.module.function` syntax. However, full LANGUAGE_SPEC.zen compliance requires substantial additional work.

## Completed Work

### âœ… Parser Improvements
- **@std.module.function syntax**: Parser now correctly handles `@std.io.println()` and similar stdlib calls
- **Member access chains**: Fixed parsing of chained member access from @std references
- **Module function recognition**: Parser distinguishes module function calls from method calls

### âœ… Basic Functionality Working
- Simple function definitions: `main = () void { ... }`
- Integer and float variables with type annotations
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Standard library functions: `@std.io.println()`, `@std.io.print_int()`, `@std.io.print_float()`
- Function calls and returns

## Current Limitations

### ðŸ”´ Critical Issues Blocking LANGUAGE_SPEC.zen

1. **Type System Problems**
   - User-defined structs are incorrectly classified as Generic types during parsing
   - This causes type mismatch errors when creating struct instances
   - Example: `Point` is seen as `Generic { name: "Point" }` instead of a struct type

2. **Missing Assignment Operators**
   - No support for `::=` (mutable assignment)
   - Only `:` type annotation works, not `=` for type inference

3. **Pattern Matching Not Implemented**
   - `?` operator for pattern matching doesn't work
   - Pattern arms syntax `| Variant { ... }` not supported
   - Boolean pattern matching incomplete

4. **Missing Core Types**
   - `Option<T>` with `Some/None` not implemented
   - `Result<T, E>` with `Ok/Err` not implemented
   - These are fundamental to the "no null" design principle

5. **Enum System Incomplete**
   - Variant syntax `Shape: Circle | Rectangle` not working
   - Enum literal shorthand `.Variant` has issues
   - Pattern matching on enums broken

## Required Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Fix Type System (High Priority)
1. Refactor type resolution to distinguish struct types from generics
2. Add symbol table tracking for user-defined types during parsing
3. Fix struct instantiation type checking

### Phase 2: Core Language Features
1. Implement `::=` mutable assignment operator
2. Add type inference for `=` assignments
3. Implement `?` pattern matching operator
4. Add support for pattern arms with guards

### Phase 3: Standard Types
1. Implement `Option<T>` enum with Some/None variants
2. Implement `Result<T, E>` enum with Ok/Err variants
3. Add `.raise()` error propagation mechanism
4. Implement pointer types: `Ptr<>`, `MutPtr<>`, `RawPtr<>`

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
1. Destructuring imports: `{ io, math } = @std`
2. Behaviors/traits: `.implements()` and `.requires()`
3. Loop constructs: `loop()` and `.loop()`
4. Range syntax: `(0..10)`
5. String interpolation: `"${variable}"`
6. Compile-time metaprogramming: `@meta.comptime`

## Testing Status

### Working Examples
```zen
main = () void {
    @std.io.println("Hello, Zen!")
    x: i32 = 42
    @std.io.print_int(x)
}
```

### Failing Examples (from LANGUAGE_SPEC.zen)
```zen
// Type inference - FAILS
x = 42  

// Mutable assignment - FAILS
counter ::= 0

// Struct creation - FAILS (type mismatch)
p = Point { x: 10, y: 20 }

// Pattern matching - FAILS
maybe_value ?
    | Some(v) { process(v) }
    | None { default() }
```

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Focus**: Fix the struct type system issue as it blocks basic usage
2. **MVP Target**: Get a minimal subset working with structs, basic pattern matching, and Option type
3. **Architecture**: Consider refactoring the type system to use a proper symbol table with type resolution phases
4. **Testing**: Create comprehensive test suite for each feature before implementation

## Files Modified
- `src/parser/expressions.rs`: Updated to handle @std member access chains
- `src/parser/types.rs`: Identified type resolution issues
- `src/codegen/llvm/expressions.rs`: Supports stdlib function calls
- `src/codegen/llvm/functions.rs`: Handles module.function naming

## Conclusion
While progress has been made on parsing @std syntax, the Zen language implementation requires significant additional work to support LANGUAGE_SPEC.zen. The most critical issue is the type system's inability to properly distinguish and handle user-defined struct types, which blocks even basic struct usage.
