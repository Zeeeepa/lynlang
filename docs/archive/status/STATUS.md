# Zen Language Implementation Status

This document tracks the current implementation status of Zen language features against the canonical `LANGUAGE_SPEC.zen`.

## ✅ Implemented Features

### Core Language

#### Basic Syntax
- ✅ Comments (single-line `//` and multi-line `/* */`)
- ✅ Basic function definitions with type annotations
- ✅ Variable declarations with type annotations
- ✅ Immutable bindings (`:`)
- ✅ String literals and basic string operations
- ✅ Integer and float literals
- ✅ Boolean literals
- ✅ Basic arithmetic operators

#### Type System
- ✅ Basic type checking for primitives (i32, f64, bool, string)
- ✅ Function type signatures
- ✅ Struct definitions with fields
- ✅ Basic generic syntax parsing (limited codegen)
- ⚠️ Type inference (partial - works for basic cases)

#### Control Flow
- ✅ If expressions (basic form)
- ✅ Loop statements with break/continue
- ⚠️ Pattern matching with `?` operator (parsing only, limited codegen)

#### Functions
- ✅ Function definitions with parameters and return types
- ✅ Function calls with arguments
- ✅ Main function entry point
- ⚠️ Anonymous functions (parsing only)

#### Structs and Methods
- ✅ Struct definitions
- ✅ Struct field access with `.` operator
- ✅ Struct initialization with field values
- ⚠️ Method definitions (parsing only, limited codegen)

#### Module System
- ✅ Import statements with `@std` syntax
- ✅ Destructuring imports `{ io } = @std`
- ⚠️ Module exports (limited)

### Standard Library

#### Core Modules
- ✅ `io` module with `println` function
- ✅ `mem` module basics
- ⚠️ `fs` module (partial)
- ⚠️ `net` module (partial)

## 🚧 In Progress Features

### Type System Enhancements
- 🚧 Complete generic type parameters for functions and structs
- 🚧 Type inference improvements
- 🚧 Distinguishing user-defined types from generics

### Pattern Matching
- 🚧 Full `?` operator implementation for enums
- 🚧 Pattern matching in variable bindings
- 🚧 Exhaustiveness checking

### Memory Management
- 🚧 Reference types (`&` and `&mut`)
- 🚧 Ownership semantics
- 🚧 Automatic memory management

## ❌ Not Yet Implemented

### Core Language Features
- ❌ Mutable assignment operator `::=`
- ❌ Defer statements
- ❌ Comptime evaluation beyond constants
- ❌ Range operators (`..` and `..=`)
- ❌ String interpolation `${}`
- ❌ Array literals and operations
- ❌ HashMap literals
- ❌ Error propagation with `raise`
- ❌ This/self in methods
- ❌ Uniform Function Call syntax (UFC)

### Type System
- ❌ Trait/behavior system (`.implements()` and `.requires()`)
- ❌ Associated types
- ❌ Type aliases
- ❌ Enum types with payloads (full implementation)
- ❌ Option<T> and Result<T,E> as built-in types

### Advanced Features
- ❌ Async/await and colorless concurrency
- ❌ Actor model
- ❌ Build system integration (`build.zen`)
- ❌ Package management
- ❌ FFI (Foreign Function Interface)
- ❌ WASM compilation target

### Tooling
- ⚠️ Language Server Protocol (LSP) - basic implementation exists
- ⚠️ Formatter - basic implementation exists
- ❌ Debugger support
- ❌ Documentation generator
- ❌ Test framework integration

## Known Issues

1. **Type System**: Cannot properly distinguish between user-defined struct types and generic parameters, blocking many advanced features
2. **Pattern Matching**: Parser accepts pattern matching syntax but codegen is incomplete
3. **Generic Codegen**: Generic functions and structs parse but don't generate correct LLVM IR
4. **Import System**: Imports are parsed but not fully resolved or validated
5. **Memory Safety**: No ownership checking or borrow checker implemented

## Testing Status

- ✅ Basic compilation tests pass
- ✅ Simple function and arithmetic tests pass
- ⚠️ Some pattern matching tests parse but don't execute correctly
- ❌ Generic type tests fail at codegen
- ❌ Advanced feature tests not yet written

## Priority Roadmap

1. **Fix Type System** - Implement proper symbol table to distinguish user types from generics
2. **Complete Assignment Operators** - Implement `=` for immutable and `::=` for mutable
3. **Implement Option<T>** - Add as built-in type with basic pattern matching
4. **Complete Pattern Matching** - Full `?` operator support for control flow
5. **Enhance LSP** - Improve diagnostics and add go-to-definition
