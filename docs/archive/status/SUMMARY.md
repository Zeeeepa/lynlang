# Zen Language Implementation Summary

## Goal Achieved ✅

Successfully implemented core features from `LANGUAGE_SPEC.zen` and created a working Zen programming language with:

1. **No Keywords Design** - Pattern matching with `?` operator replaces all traditional control flow keywords
2. **Working Compiler** - Rust-based implementation with LLVM backend
3. **Comprehensive Test Suite** - All tests in `tests/` folder, prefixed with `zen_test_`
4. **Updated README** - Accurately reflects what's implemented from LANGUAGE_SPEC.zen

## Working Features from LANGUAGE_SPEC.zen

### Core Language Features
- ✅ Variable declarations: `x = 10` (immutable), `y ::= 20` (mutable)
- ✅ String interpolation: `"Hello ${name}!"`
- ✅ Pattern matching: `value ? | true { } | false { }`
- ✅ Structs with mutable fields: `Point: { x:: f64, y:: f64 }`
- ✅ UFC (Uniform Function Call): `num.double()` calls `double(num)`
- ✅ Range loops: `(0..10).loop((i) { })`
- ✅ Infinite loops: `loop { break }`
- ✅ @std imports: `{ io } = @std`

### Test Files Created
All in `tests/` folder:
- `zen_test_spec_working.zen` - Main comprehensive test of all working features
- `zen_test_spec_variables.zen` - Variable declaration forms
- `zen_test_spec_patterns.zen` - Pattern matching examples
- `zen_test_spec_ranges.zen` - Range loop tests
- `zen_test_string_interp.zen` - String interpolation
- `zen_test_ufc_simple.zen` - UFC examples

### Key Implementation Files
- `src/lexer.rs` - Handles tokenization including `${}` interpolation
- `src/parser/` - Parses Zen syntax to AST
- `src/typechecker/` - Type checking and inference
- `src/codegen/llvm/` - LLVM IR generation

## Not Yet Implemented (from LANGUAGE_SPEC.zen)

Advanced features still to be implemented:
- Traits with `.implements()` and `.requires()`
- Full generics with constraints
- Allocator-based async/sync
- Compile-time metaprogramming (`@meta.comptime`)
- Actors and concurrency primitives
- Module exports/imports system
- Pointer types (`Ptr<>`, `MutPtr<>`, `RawPtr<>`)
- Step ranges `(0..100).step(10)`
- Forward declarations

## How to Run

```bash
# Build the compiler
cargo build --release

# Run tests
./target/release/zen tests/zen_test_spec_working.zen

# Run any Zen program
./target/release/zen program.zen
```

## Conclusion

The Zen language now has a working implementation that follows the core principles from `LANGUAGE_SPEC.zen`:
- No keywords - everything is patterns and functions
- UFC allows any function to be called as a method
- Pattern matching with `?` replaces all control flow
- String interpolation works
- The foundation is solid for implementing remaining features

The README has been updated to accurately reflect the current state, with clear references to `LANGUAGE_SPEC.zen` line numbers for each feature.
