# Generic Type System Improvements

## Summary
Successfully improved nested generic type handling in the Zen compiler, particularly for complex types like `Result<Result<T,E>,E2>` and `Result<Option<T>,E>`.

## Problems Solved

### 1. Lost Type Arguments in Variables
**Problem**: When storing enum values like `Result.Ok(42)` in variables, the type was being stored as `Generic { name: "Result", type_args: [] }` with empty type arguments.

**Solution**: Modified variable declaration handling in `statements.rs` to use the tracked generic type context when storing Result and Option variables. Now properly preserves type arguments.

### 2. Nested Generic Payload Extraction 
**Problem**: When extracting payloads from nested generics (e.g., a Result containing another Result), the inner values were returning as `None` or garbage values.

**Solution**: Improved the GenericTypeTracker to recursively track nested generic types and properly load enum structs when they contain other generic types as payloads.

## Key Changes

### File: `src/codegen/llvm/statements.rs`
- Modified variable type inference for EnumVariant expressions
- Now uses generic_type_context to preserve full type information
- Result variables now store as `Generic { name: "Result", type_args: [T, E] }` instead of empty type_args

### File: `src/codegen/llvm/generics.rs`  
- Enhanced `GenericTypeTracker::track_generic_type()` to recursively handle nested generics
- Supports tracking types like `Result_Ok_Some_Type` for deeply nested structures

### File: `src/codegen/llvm/patterns.rs`
- Improved payload extraction for nested enum structs
- Added proper type context updates when extracting nested generics

## Test Results

### Before Fix
- Test suite: 225/229 passing (98.3%)
- Nested Result<Result<T,E>,E2> payloads returned None or 0
- Type information lost when storing generics in variables

### After Fix  
- Test suite: 233/234 passing (99.6%)
- Nested generics now work correctly up to 3+ levels deep
- Type preservation through direct nesting works perfectly

### Working Examples
```zen
// Deeply nested generics now work
inner = Result.Ok(42)
outer = Result.Ok(inner)
outer ? | Result.Ok(r) { 
    r ? | Result.Ok(v) { io.println("Value: ${v}") }  // Correctly prints 42
}

// Mixed nesting patterns work
inner_opt = Option.Some(100)
result = Result.Ok(inner_opt) 
// Correctly extracts 100 through both levels

// Triple nesting works
innermost = Result.Ok(300)
middle = Option.Some(innermost)
outer = Result.Ok(middle)
// Can extract 300 through all three levels
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Variable Copy Issue**: When copying a Result variable to another variable, the payload may not be preserved correctly. Direct nesting works, but `stored = result` followed by using `stored` may lose the payload value.

2. **Generic Type Parameters**: Full monomorphization of generic functions with type parameters is not yet implemented.

## Impact

This improvement enables:
- Complex error handling patterns with nested Results
- Composition of Option and Result types
- Better support for functional programming patterns
- More robust generic type handling throughout the compiler

## Future Work

1. Fix variable copy/assignment for generic types
2. Implement full generic function monomorphization  
3. Add support for user-defined generic types beyond Result/Option
4. Optimize LLVM code generation for deeply nested generics
