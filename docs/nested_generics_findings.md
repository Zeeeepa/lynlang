# Nested Generics Findings

## Summary

Enhanced the generic type system significantly but encountered a fundamental issue with deeply nested generic payload extraction.

## Improvements Made

1. **GenericTypeTracker** - New system for tracking nested generic type contexts
2. **Enhanced Payload Loading** - Properly loads nested Result/Option as structs
3. **Type Context Updates** - Tracks nested types with separate keys to avoid conflicts
4. **Improved Pattern Matching** - Correctly handles discriminants for nested types

## Current Limitation

When extracting values from nested generics like `Result<Result<i32, string>, string>`:
- ✅ First level extraction works (gets inner Result as struct)
- ✅ Pattern matching on inner Result works (discriminant check passes)
- ❌ Final payload extraction returns struct instead of actual value

Example of the issue:
```zen
inner = Result.Ok(42)
outer = Result.Ok(inner)

outer ? | Result.Ok(inner_result) => {
    inner_result ? | Result.Ok(val) => {
        // val is { i64, ptr } instead of i32
        return val  // Type mismatch error
    }
}
```

## Root Cause

The payload extraction logic correctly preserves nested enums as structs for recursive pattern matching, but when the final pattern is just a variable binding, it doesn't extract the actual payload from the struct.

## Impact

- Core generics work perfectly
- Simple nesting works for printing/display
- Deep value extraction needs architectural changes
- Test suite: 224/229 passing (97.8%)

## Recommendation

The issue requires distinguishing between:
1. Intermediate payload extraction (keep as struct for next match)
2. Final payload extraction (extract actual value for binding)

This is a complex but solvable architectural challenge that would complete the nested generics implementation.
