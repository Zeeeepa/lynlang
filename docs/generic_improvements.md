# Generic Type System Improvements

## Summary of Work Done (2025-09-25)

### Accomplishments

1. **Enhanced Generic Type Tracker**
   - Implemented recursive generic type tracking in `GenericTypeTracker`
   - Added support for deeply nested generic types like `Result<Result<T,E>,E2>`
   - Improved type context propagation through pattern matching

2. **Fixed Nested Generic Payload Extraction**
   - Modified raise() to properly detect and load nested Result/Option structs
   - Added heap allocation for nested enum structs to preserve payloads
   - Fixed struct type detection for aggregate values in LLVM IR

3. **Improved raise() Implementation**
   - Enhanced type tracking during raise() operations
   - Added proper handling for nested Result/Option types
   - Successfully loads nested Result structs from heap memory

### Current Status

The nested generic payload extraction is working at the LLVM level - we can successfully:
- Create nested Results like `Result<Result<i32, string>, string>`
- Extract the inner Result using `.raise()`
- Load the struct correctly from heap memory
- Return it as a proper Result struct value

### Remaining Issues

1. **Variable Type Inference**
   - When a variable is assigned from `raise()`, its type isn't properly tracked
   - Example: `inner = outer.raise()` doesn't know `inner` is `Result<i32, string>`
   - This causes the second `raise()` to fail with "Unsupported Result type"

2. **Pattern Matching Integration**
   - While pattern matching works for directly created nested Results
   - Variables storing Results from raise() lose payload values (become 0)
   - The type context isn't properly maintained through variable assignments

### Test Results

#### Working Tests
- `test_nested_result_simple.zen` - Pattern matching on nested Results works
- `test_nested_direct.zen` - Direct creation and extraction works
- `test_nested_raise_step.zen` - Single raise extraction works (but payload becomes 0)

#### Failing Tests  
- `test_raise_nested_result.zen` - Double raise fails on type error
- `test_nested_raise_two.zen` - Second raise doesn't recognize Result type

### Root Cause

The fundamental issue is that the Zen type system doesn't properly track generic types through:
1. Variable assignments from generic function returns
2. raise() expression results
3. Pattern matching on generic types stored in variables

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Improve Variable Type Tracking**
   - Enhance `infer_expression_type()` to handle raise() results
   - Track generic types in variable declarations
   - Preserve generic type information through assignments

2. **Fix Type Context Propagation**
   - Ensure generic_type_context is updated when variables are assigned
   - Maintain type information for Results stored in variables
   - Properly type variables that hold generic structs

3. **Complete Nested Generic Support**
   - Fix payload preservation in pattern matching
   - Ensure nested Results maintain their payload pointers
   - Add comprehensive tests for all nested generic scenarios

### Code Locations

- Generic type tracker: `src/codegen/llvm/generics.rs`
- raise() implementation: `src/codegen/llvm/expressions.rs:5761-6530`
- Pattern matching: `src/codegen/llvm/patterns.rs`
- Variable declarations: `src/codegen/llvm/statements.rs`

### Technical Details

The issue occurs because:
1. raise() successfully returns a `{ i64, ptr }` struct for nested Results
2. This struct is stored in a variable with inferred type
3. The type inference doesn't recognize it as `Result<T,E>` 
4. When raise() is called again, it fails because it sees an i32/struct, not a Result
5. Pattern matching extracts 0 because the payload pointer isn't being dereferenced correctly

The fix requires:
- Better type tracking for variables assigned from generic expressions
- Proper type context updates when storing generic values
- Correct payload dereferencing in pattern matching for generic types
