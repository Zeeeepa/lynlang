## Critical Issues Summary

### Must Fix (Spec Violations):
1. **Remove ALL `if`/`else` keywords** - 1849 occurrences violate core philosophy
2. **Replace raw pointer syntax** (`*`) with Ptr<T>/RawPtr<T>
3. **Implement proper array syntax** `[N, T]`
4. **Remove tuple usage** - structs only for product types
5. **Implement behaviors** as function pointer structs
6. **Implement colorless async** via allocators

### High Priority:
1. Standardize variable declaration syntax
2. Complete UFCS implementation
3. Implement FFI builder pattern
4. Fix module import consistency
5. Complete standard library alignment

### Medium Priority:
1. Complete self-hosting capability
2. Implement comprehensive testing framework
3. Add platform-specific code handling
4. Improve error propagation syntax
5. Complete GPA implementation

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Syntax Migration Script**: Create automated tool to replace `if`/`else` with `?` operator
2. **Pointer Syntax Converter**: Automate conversion from `*` to Ptr<T>
3. **Lint Tool**: Implement zen-lint to enforce spec compliance
4. **Standard Library Rewrite**: Systematically update all stdlib modules

### Short-term (1-2 weeks):
1. Complete pattern matching migration
2. Fix array syntax throughout codebase
3. Implement behaviors properly
4. Update all examples to be spec-compliant

### Medium-term (1 month):
1. Implement colorless async system
2. Complete FFI builder pattern
3. Achieve self-hosting milestone
4. Full standard library compliance

### Long-term (2-3 months):
1. Production-ready compiler
2. Comprehensive tooling ecosystem
3. Performance optimizations
4. Documentation and tutorials

## File-by-File Issues

### Most Critical Files to Fix:
1. `/stdlib/**/*.zen` - 138 files with `if`/`else`
2. `/compiler/*.zen` - Core compiler files non-compliant
3. `/tests/*.zen` - Test files set bad examples
4. `/tools/*.zen` - Tooling uses wrong patterns

**Overall: 5.5/10** - Significant work needed for spec compliance

## Conclusion

The ZenLang implementation has made good progress in some areas but has critical gaps in core language philosophy compliance. The most urgent issue is the widespread use of `if`/`else` keywords, which directly violates the fundamental design principle of using only the `?` operator for conditionals.

With focused effort on the critical issues identified, the implementation could reach 8-9/10 alignment within 1-2 months. The foundation is solid, but systematic refactoring is required to achieve full spec compliance.
