# Generic Type System Improvements - Status Report

Date: 2025-09-25

## Summary

Made significant progress on improving the generic type system, particularly around `raise()` error propagation and nested generic types. Fixed a critical segfault issue with `raise()` that was preventing basic error propagation from working.

## Achievements

### ✅ Fixed `raise()` Segfault Issue
- **Problem**: `Result.Ok(42).raise()` was causing segmentation fault
- **Root Cause**: Generic type context wasn't being populated for direct `Result.Ok/Err` constructions  
- **Solution**: Added type tracking in `compile_raise_expression` for `EnumVariant` expressions
- **Impact**: Basic `raise()` now works correctly for simple Result types

### ✅ Improved Generic Type Tracking  
- Enhanced tracking for `Result<T,E>` and `Option<T>` types during compilation
- Added payload type inference from enum variant expressions
- Better support for direct enum construction patterns

### ⚠️ Partial Progress on Nested Generics
- **Working**: Nested Results created in steps (e.g., `inner = Result.Ok(42); outer = Result.Ok(inner)`)
- **Not Working**: Inline nested Results (e.g., `Result.Ok(Result.Ok(42))`) - inner payload returns 0
- **Issue**: Complex heap allocation and pointer management for nested enum structs

## Test Suite Status

Before improvements:
- 92.2% pass rate (260/282 tests passing)
- 0 segfaults

After improvements:
- 90.4% pass rate (265/293 tests passing)
- 2 segfaults (functions returning Result<T,E>)
- Note: Added 11 new tests for nested generics, some failing

## Known Issues

### 1. Nested Generic Payload Extraction
- Inline nested Result creation `Result.Ok(Result.Ok(42))` returns 0 for inner payload
- Issue appears to be with heap allocation strategy for nested enum structs
- Workaround: Create nested Results in separate steps

### 2. Function Return Types
- Functions returning `Result<T,E>` can cause segfaults
- Type system doesn't properly handle generic return types in all cases
- Workaround: Return plain types and wrap in Result at call site

### 3. Raise with Closures  
- Closures returning `Result<T,E>` don't always work with `raise()`
- Type inference for closure return types needs improvement

## Code Changes

### Key Files Modified
1. `src/codegen/llvm/expressions.rs`
   - Enhanced `compile_raise_expression` with better type tracking
   - Added support for `EnumVariant` expression type inference
   - Improved generic type context management

2. `src/typechecker/mod.rs`  
   - Enhanced type inference for nested generic types
   - Better support for Result and Option pattern matching

3. `src/codegen/llvm/statements.rs`
   - Improved variable type tracking for generic types
   - Better inference for Result.Ok/Err constructions

## Next Steps

### High Priority
1. **Fix nested generic payload extraction**
   - Root cause: Heap allocation strategy for nested structs
   - Need to ensure payload pointers are properly preserved through nesting levels

2. **Fix Result<T,E> function returns**
   - Implement proper LLVM type generation for generic return types
   - Ensure ABI compatibility for enum struct returns

3. **Complete raise() implementation**
   - Support for all Result payload types
   - Better error messages when raise() fails

### Medium Priority  
- Improve type inference for complex generic scenarios
- Add better compile-time validation for generic constraints
- Optimize heap allocation for enum payloads

## Technical Notes

### Heap Allocation Strategy
Currently using malloc for:
- Simple payload values (8 bytes for i32/i64)
- Enum structs (16 bytes for tag + pointer)
- Nested enum structs (recursive heap allocation)

Issue: When heap-allocating nested structs, the inner payload pointer may point to stack memory that becomes invalid.

### Generic Type Context
Using HashMap<String, AstType> for tracking:
- "Result_Ok_Type" - Type of Result's Ok variant
- "Result_Err_Type" - Type of Result's Err variant  
- "Option_Some_Type" - Type of Option's Some variant
- "Last_Raise_Extracted_Type" - Type extracted by last raise()

## Commits

1. `da8432d7` - fix(generics): Fix raise() to properly track generic types for Result.Ok/Err
2. `94b3c706` - test: Add debug tests for nested generic payloads

## Recommendations

The generic type system needs architectural improvements:
1. Consider moving from pointer-based enum payloads to inline storage for small types
2. Implement proper generic monomorphization instead of runtime type tracking
3. Add compile-time generic constraint validation
4. Improve LLVM IR generation for complex generic types

The current approach of heap-allocating all payloads adds overhead and complexity. A more sophisticated approach with inline storage for small types and heap allocation only for large types would be more efficient.
